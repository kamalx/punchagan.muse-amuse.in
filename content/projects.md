This is a list of some of the projects that I have worked on in the past, or am
currently working on.


## Howdy {#howdy}

Inspired by [Sacha Chua](http://sachachua.com/blog/2005/05/keeping-in-touch/) and [Michael Fogleman](https://mwfogleman.github.io/posts/08-01-2015-emacs-can-keep-in-touch.html) to try to keep in touch with
friends and family better, I built a tool to keep track of my interactions.


## Cows & Bulls {#cows-and-bulls}

I built this site, in memory of the best cows & bulls player I've known. It is
a simple client-side page with javascript that works offline too.


## Statiki {#statiki}

Statiki leverages free and open services and software like GitHub, TravisCI and
Nikola to provide a means of deploying static websites, without needing any
setup on the users' machine.


## GetHub {#gethub}

GetHub was made for the geeks whose primary Social Network is GitHub and who
keep checking for updates, a dozen times every hour. :)

This extension was written when pop-up notifications were newly introduced into
Chrome, and I was excited by it.  I now prefer a workspace with fewer
distractions, and no longer use this.


## Nikola orgmode plugin {#nikola-orgmode-plugin}

Nikola supports multiple markup formats as input, `orgmode` being one of them.
The support for this is added by this plugin, and this blog is generated using
this plugin.


## cinspect {#cinspect}

`cinspect` attempts to extend Python's built-in inspect module to add
"inspection" for Python's builtins and other objects not written in Python.  It
uses `libclang` to parse C-code and indexes it to allow looking up the source
of the required objects, using an `inspect`-like API.

The original idea was from a friend, [Tom Ballinger](https://twitter.com/ballingt/statuses/483394809411825665), who also helped me design
and test it out.


## Blaggregator {#blaggregator}

Recursers write awesome blog posts all over the internet, and `blaggregator` is
a Django powered site that aggregates all these posts. (You will need an RC
login to view it).

The project was originally thought of, and built by [Sasha](https://github.com/sursh).  I've added a bunch
of features to it, and help with maintaining it.


## Nikola {#nikola}

Nikola is a static site and blog generator written in Python that can generate
a blog from input in many different markup formats.

This website has been generated using Nikola. I use the development branch of
Nikola and actively contribute to the development of features that I need or
fix bugs that affect me.


## org2blog {#org2blog}

I no longer actively maintain `org2blog` since I don't use any Wordpress blogs,
anymore.  If you are interested in maintaining this project, do get in touch.
