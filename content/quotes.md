A collection of quotes. I keep coming back to them for inspiration. Or for
brighter perspectives on life.

-   Furious activity is no substitute for understanding. --
    _H.H. Williams -- Activity_

-   A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,
    butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet,
    balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take
    orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze
    a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal,
    fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.  --
    _Robert A. Heinlein -- Human Beings_

-   Nothing ever becomes real till it is experienced -- even a proverb is
    no proverb to you till your life has illustrated it. -- _John Keats_

-   We lie loudest when we lie to ourselves. -- _Eric Hoffer_

-   The first hour of the morning is the rudder of the day. -- _Henry
    Ward Beecher_

    for machines to execute. -- _Abelson & Sussman -- SICP, preface to
    the first edition_

-   In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst
    into flame by an encounter with another human being. We should all be
    thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit.  -- _Albert
    Schweitzer, 1875 - 1965_

    tolerable subhuman who has learned to wear shoes, bathe and not make messes
    in the house.  -- _Lazarus Long, Time Enough for Love_

-   You probably wouldn't worry about what people think of you if you could know
    how seldom they do. -- _Olin Miller_

-   If you judge people, you have no time to love them. -- _Mother Teresa_

    giving it. -- _William Arthur Ward_

-   <p class="verse">
    Where the mind is without fear and the head held high;<br />
    Where knowledge is free;<br />
    Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;<br />
    Where words come out from the depth of truth;<br />
    Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;<br />
    Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;<br />
    Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action;<br />
    Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.<br />
    </p>

    _Rabindranath Tagore -- Let My Country Awake_

-   The true Enlightenment thinker, the true rationalist, never wants to talk
    anyone into anything. No, he does not even want to convince; all the time he
    is aware that he may be wrong. Above all, he values the intellectual
    independence of others too highly to want to convince them in important
    matters. He would much rather invite contradiction, preferably in the form of
    rational and disciplined criticism. He seeks not to convince but to arouse --
    to challenge others to form free opinions. -- _Karl Popper -- On Freedom_

-   Don't ask yourself what the world needs; ask yourself what makes you come
    alive. And then go and do that. Because what the world needs is people who
    have come alive. -- _Howard Thurman_

-   All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn't hurt. --
    _Charles M Schultz_

-   Somewhere in the world someone is training when you are not. When you race
    him, he will win. -- _Tom Fleming_

-   Because when something happens, she's the person I want to tell. The
    most basic indicator of love. -- _David Levithan_

-   If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product,
    you've launched too late. -- _Reid Hoffman_

-   Nothing of me is original. I am the combined effort of everyone I've ever
    known. -- _Chuck Palahniuk_

-   I fell in love with the way you sleep; slowly then all at once -- _John
    Green_

-   The enjoyment of one's tools is an essential ingredient of successful
    work. -- _Donald E. Knuth_

-   Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything that no longer serves you,
    grows you, or makes you happy. -- _Robert Tew_

-   It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves. -- _William
    Shakespeare_

-   I saw that my life was a vast glowing empty page and I could do anything I
    wanted. -- _Jack Kerouac_

-   The truth is, everyone is going to hurt you. You just got to find the ones
    worth suffering for. -- _Bob Marley_

-   Scientists study the world as it is; engineers create the world that has
    never been. -- _Theodore von Karman_

-   If you can love someone with your whole heart, even one person, then there's
    salvation in life. Even if you can’t get together with that person. --
    _Haruki Murakami_

-   The truth is rarely pure and never simple -- _Oscar Wilde_

-   Memories warm you up from the inside. But they also tear you apart. --
    _Haruki Murakami_

-   We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a
    habit. -- _Aristotle_

-   Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in a long-shot. --
    _Charlie Chaplin_

-   Another flaw in the human character is that everyone wants to build and
    nobody wants to do maintenance. -- _Kurt Vonnegut_

-   In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes
    on. -- _Robert Frost_

-   Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore,
    if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not
    smart enough to debug it. -- _Brian Kernighan_

-   Lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save;
    they just stand there shining. -- _Anne Lamott_

-   Life is an awful, ugly place to not have a best friend. -- _Sarah Dessen_

-   Warning: everything saved will be lost. -- _Wii notification_

-   Happiness is nothing more than good health and a bad memory.  -- _Albert
    Schweitzer_

-   Silence is the language of god. All else is poor translation. -- _Rumi_

-   To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will
    certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of
    keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an
    animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all
    entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your
    selfishness. But in that casket -- safe, dark, motionless, airless -- it will
    change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable,
    irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy,
    is damnation. The only place outside of Heaven where you can be perfectly
    safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell. -- _C. S. Lewis_

-   Quality is the result of a million selfless acts of care -- not just of any
    great method that descends from the heavens. That these acts are simple
    doesn't mean that they are simplistic; and it hardly means that they are
    easy. They are nonetheless the fabric of greatness and, more so, of beauty in
    any human endeavor. To ignore them is not yet to be fully human.  -- _James
    O. Coplien, Foreword to Clean Code_

-   We are all in the same boat, in a stormy sea, and we owe each other a
    terrible loyalty. -- _G.K. Chesterton_

-   The road to wisdom? -- Well, it's plain and simple to express:

    <p class="verse">
    Err<br />
    and err<br />
    and err again<br />
    but less<br />
    and less<br />
    and less.<br />
    </p>

    -- _Piet Hein (Grooks)_

-   My idea of dominating is that I get all of the players on my team to play
    better than if I wasn't there. -- _Ben Wiggins_

-   It is a risk to love. What if it doesn't work out? Ah, but what if it does.
    -- _Peter McWilliams_

-   Wherever you go, go with all your heart -- _Confucius_

-   Satisfaction of one's curiosity is one of the greatest sources of happiness
    in life. -- _Linus Pauling_

-   I wanted to change the world. But I have found that the only thing one can be
    sure of changing is oneself. -- _Aldous Huxley_

-   The true voyage of discovery consists not of going to new places, but of
    having a new pair of eyes. -- _Marcel Proust (1871–1922)_

-   All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. --
    _Edmund Burke_

-   I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep
    fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course,
    the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we
    began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really
    were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these
    machines. I don't think we are. I think we're responsible for stretching
    them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I
    hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I
    hope we don't become missionaries. Don't feel as if you're Bible
    salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What you know about
    computing other people will learn. Don't feel as if the key to successful
    computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think and hope, is
    intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first
    led up to it, that you can make it more. -- _Alan J. Perlis (April 1,
    1922-February 7, 1990)_

-   Forgetting is like radiation: you cannot smell it, you cannot taste it, and
    when you finally notice the damage, it is already irreversible -- _Piotr
    Wozniack_

-   Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about
    telescopes -- _Edsger Dijkstra_

-   Do anything, but let it produce joy. -- _Walt Whitman_

-   Learn to value yourself, which means: fight for your happiness -- _Ayn Rand_

-   If you don't stand for something you will fall for anything -- _Malcolm X_

-   Do you want to know who you are? Don't ask. Act! Action will delineate and
    define you -- _Thomas Jefferson_

-   We will be held accountable for all the permitted pleasures we failed to
    enjoy. -- _Talmud Yerwshalmi_

    Smiths_

    quality. -- _Fred Brooks_

    requirement. -- _Gerald Weinberg_

-   Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you
    didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from
    the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your
    sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. -- _Mark Twain_

-   Be careful when you fight the monsters, lest you become one. -- _Friedrich
    Nietzsche_

-   Assume nobody else has any idea what they're doing either. A lot of people
    refuse to try something because they feel they don't know enough about it or
    they assume other people must have already tried everything they could have
    thought of. Well, few people really have any idea how to do things right and
    even fewer are to try new things, so usually if you give your best shot at
    something you'll do pretty well. -- _Aaron Swartz_

-   What makes this advice especially hollow and pious is that I am not dead
    yet. If it were any good, I could easily take it myself.  -- _Kurt Vonnegut,
    in a letter to his daughter Nanny_

-   Go out and walk. That is the glory of life. -- _Artist Maira Kalman_

-   I think it's pretty cool that there are tutorials to do things that are
    pretty near the state of the art. -- _Dan L. on tutorials in Theano for doing
    Deep Learning stuff_

-   All things worth doing are frustrating. How much satisfaction do you get from
    doing something easy? -- _Joe Armstrong_ on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joeerl/status/673428125737459712)

-   Be happy with what you have. Be excited about what you want. -- _Alan Cohen_

    long time, of the shore. -- _André Gide_ in Les faux-monnayeurs [The
    Counterfeiters]

    seconds to do by hand -- _Douglas Adams_ in [Last Chance to See](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/587524-i-have-a-well-deserved-reputation-for-being-something-of-a).

-   Don't wait for a light to appear at the end of the tunnel, stride down there
    and light the bloody thing yourself. -- _Sara Henderson_ in [From Strength to
    Strength](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes_of_the_day/1746)

-   It doesn't matter where you are, you are nowhere compared to where you can
    go. -- _Bob Proctor_

-   Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of high intention,
    sincere effort, intelligent direction and skillful execution; it represents
    the wise choice of many alternatives. -- _William A. Foster_

-   How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives -- _Annie Dillard_

-   The truth is, most of us discover where we are headed when we arrive. --
    _Bill Watterson_

    all. Give 'em a hug. -- _Jason Zimdars_ in this [post](https://m.signalvnoise.com/why-i-work-remotely-hint-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-productivity-34ace30f74fc#.jliostsa5)
