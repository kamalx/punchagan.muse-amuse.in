After a trek, I had an interesting conversation with Ritesh, about
taking pictures during a trip. He said, he started to realize that
when he's lost in the cycle of click, see, analyze, click,
... when he's got a cam in his hand. He didn't have a cam on this
trek and thoroughly enjoyed it!

I connect to this phenomenon, as well. I think, like Ritesh says,
having separate trips for Photography makes sense. On other trips,
we could be clicking, but just for the sake of memory. Trying to
get amazing photographs shouldn't be a goal.
I should refrain from -

1.  looking at the output and adjusting repeatedly until it's
    perfect.
2.  clicking too many pictures in a given length of time.

For both of this, a film camera seems to be the solution!

What say, Ritesh?
