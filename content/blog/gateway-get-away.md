A Rocking.. err.. Pebbling.. err.. Pedaling Trip. IIT Bombay,
Powai to the Gateway of India. I simply loved it!

The original plan was to land somewhere near Chowpatty beach, but
I had some useless landmarks and I got lost. I was not too
particular about going to a particular place, so didn't try too
hard to stay on track and was happy to end up at the
Gateway. Thanks to the Mumbai local, I don't know the road
routes. But, again thanks to the Mumbai local, I have a general
idea of the direction.

I woke up a bit later than scheduled, but almost made up for the
delay until I reach my cycle to find the rear tyre fully flat. I
quickly diagnosed the problem to be with the valve. But, I had no
spare valve, unless, I "borrow" it from a cycle near-by. I
replaced my valve with Vattam's cycle's and was good to go!

I didn't have a big enough water bottle, and carried along only
half a litre after drinking one half litre. The first half hour
was a breeze; possibly the best part of the whole ride. High on
energy and enthu. Then, my groin/ass started to hurt a bit. I
pulled out my music player to drown the pain in music. This kinda
worked and I pulled on pretty well until King's circle. That's
when I emptied all the water I had. I hoped to find water along
the way, if I badly needed it.

Sometime later, I had to take a right turn, but I never knew
where. I didn't bother to ask anyone, nor did I look at the
landmarks I had scribbled down. I was happy to go straight
ahead. :)

And by the time I reached CST/Fort, I did need water; badly
enough. I stopped at the next open shop (that was not a
pan-ki-dukaan) and got myself some Nimbu paani and a litre of
water (for future).

The Gateway of India was just 10 minutes away from here.  Loitered
around there, for about 40 minutes. There were a lot of Policemen
all over the place. After about 5 minutes of me reaching there,
they cleared the whole area right next to the Gateway of India. I
don't know why. (Also, all along the way, there were a lot of men
in Khaaki. I guess there's some rally or some such thing
scheduled)

On the return, I lost my way almost immediately after
starting. There was a one way road that I avoided and took the
adjacent road but ended up going off-track. I had some doubts
about this but they weren't confirmed until I reached Mahalaxmi
station! But there, a Taxi driver gave me rough guidelines to get
back on my track. I turned back and soon was "back-on-track".

I'd planned to have breakfast at Idli house, as soon as I saw it
during my onward journey. So, I went directly to Idli house, and
treated myself to a Rava idli and some wonderful Kaapi. The waiter
got tipped well, too. ;)

From Matunga, back to IIT was straight forward; except for the
growing traffic and the PITA (literally). The traffic signals were
a bit annoying, too.

On the whole was an awesome trip! I loved it. Hope to go on more
such rides. But, I guess I'll head north-ward, the next time.

By the way, it was approx. 60kms on the whole and took me 5 hours
(including the time I spent at the Gateway of India) with about 3
hours 40 mins of pedaling.. err.. rocking. :D
