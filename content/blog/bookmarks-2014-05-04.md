-   [KEEGAN: The Opposite of Loneliness | Cross Campus](http://yaledailynews.com/crosscampus/2012/05/27/keegan-the-opposite-of-loneliness/)

    The notion that it’s too late to do anything is comical. It’s
    hilarious. We’re graduating college. We’re so young. We can’t, we
    MUST not lose this sense of possibility because in the end, it’s all
    we have.

    We don’t have a word for the opposite of loneliness, but if we did,
    I’d say that’s how I feel at Yale. How I feel right now. Here. With
    all of you. In love, impressed, humbled, scared. And we don’t have
    to lose that.

    We’re in this together, 2012. Let’s make something happen to this
    world.

    My kids are not the center of my world because I love them enough
    not to allow them to be.
