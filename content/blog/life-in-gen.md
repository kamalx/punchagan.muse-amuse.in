Another post, with nothing concrete to say...

-   These are just a few random musings, for those curious about my
    life and for the good health of my Blog which is so close to its
    death..
-   College (+ Hostel) is amongst few places, that everyone on
    Earth(& elsewhere) \\\*must\\\* get the chance to be in. There's a
    whole new world out here, with hell a lotuva things you can do,
    Here and Only Here... [I am not, by any means, talking of
    acads!]
-   Projects. Yes they are a part of almost all my random
    stuff... cos I just Love them, when they are self-assigned and
    off-hand. They get even more exciting, when the learning curve
    is Steep!
-   Deadlines can be wonderful things, if only I learn to respect
    them.
-   Lab-Tests, i guess, are amongst the most hyped tests in the
    World! They aren't worth all that fuss.
-   Grades ain't everything in Life. Not even if you are doing
    Engineering!
-   I live amidst /wonderful\* singers, **marvelous** music composers,
    **facile** lyric writers, **cool** Hackers, **amazing** photographers,
    **inspiring** poets and what not. [Why the hell do people then,
    look just for the \*"industrious"/ grade scorers?]
-   Music and Sleep are Great Healers. Laughter, too, is a close
    competitor.
-   GNU/Linux is addictive. More n more people getting addicted,
    everyday!
-   RHCE's got a pretty interesting test. Its rare to be interested
    in undergoing the torture of a test, ain't it?
-   Rules seem to be total crap, until you get the chance to look at
    them from above.
-   Quark'08 coming up! Gottu gear up for it!
-   Comprees?? They don't bother me so much any more.
-   Finally, for those who found all the above stuff boring and
    dumb... here's some food for thought > The Best things in Life
    aren't Things...
