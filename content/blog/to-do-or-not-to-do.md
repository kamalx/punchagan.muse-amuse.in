Achieve something, I'm often reminded,<br />
achieve something, something that's worthwhile.<br />
Don't just kill time, they say,<br />
for, brutally, it shall kill you someday.<br />
<br />
Make the best use of time, I tell myself,<br />
for I realize, how I spend my days<br />
is how I'm spending my life and<br />
I'm going to get just one of it!<br />
<br />
But, what is worthwhile, I wonder<br />
everything seems so good one moment<br />
and all meaning vanishes the very next.<br />
I'm utterly confused, somebody help!<br />
<br />
Pick one from, spoke my brother,<br />
the 'everything' that seems good<br />
and do it right, just, do it right!<br />
Life, as you live through it, shall<br />
teach you to do things that are right<br />
and at the end of it all, you'll<br />
never regret what you've done<br />
but, only what you couldn't!<br />

    spend our lives"
