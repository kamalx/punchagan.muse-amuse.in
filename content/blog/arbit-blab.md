Well, just another post to make it clear that

-   I'm still alive
-   I haven't forgotten that I have a blog
-   I haven't forgotten my blog's password
-   I haven't lost the ability to write arbit crap.
-   I'm not busy with anything interesting
-   My Keyboard works fine

Arbit stuff going on around me off-late.

-   We've had our official farewell; So we've officially bid goodbye
    to B.I.T.S - Goa. People tried their best to make the occasion
    appear "senti" but it seemed more like "psenti" for me.
-   I wonder why our VC calls BITS as B.I.T.S; is it something
    similar to people choosing to call SAP as S.A.P?
-   Most of the advice given was of a copy-book style. But I liked
    one of them, though it wasn't expressed well enough for me -
    Learning from Books still remains an important way of learning,
    even if work teaches you a LOT.
-   College now has its own Debian Repository hosted on a server
    running Hardy. Hats off to bad\\<sub>sector</sub> for showing the enthu to
    get things done. The LUG here's got a great bunch of people
    right now and its growing in leaps and bounds. I'm excited.
-   A couple of my friends picked up Debian recently and apparently
    both of them are loving it thoroughly. Linux, as addictive as
    ever.
-   It's been a while since I've been on the winning side in
    carroms. Its so boring to be on the losing side for so long.
-   Word is not a document exchange format[^fn:1] ; Use
    html, plain text, pdf or the open document format.(if you are
    not averse to openness) [I mention this _now_ because I faced a
    lot of trouble recently trying to handle some .doc files which
    replaced the html pages that were being used on the PS site.]
-   So often, little things get blown out of proportion, so
    quickly. Or its just that not everybody sees them as 'little'
    things.
-   On slow connections, the download 'handler' of firefox does
    really poorly. It's next to impossible to download anything over
    half an MB.
-   This from the preface of SICP[^fn:2] ,a text book for an
    introductory course on Computer Programming at MIT

    I would like to see a few courses developed on similar lines here.
-   Gmail themes are good. I only tried the "Terminal" theme,
    though. I loved it!
-   For the very first time, I upgraded a distro. I successfully
    moved to Intrepid from Hardy. (and that too with the campus
    net!) This was before the repositories had been set-up. Now, it
    should be a much simpler job to achieve the same
-   Just got the news of more Violence in Mumbai; What the hell do
    these people want? I end this post here.
