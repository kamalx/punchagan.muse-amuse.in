-   [Your Code Sucks - Girl Developer](http://www.girldeveloper.com/2010/07/your-code-sucks.html)

    tags: lessons, code, programming, reading

    the only person's code that sucks is my own, and the reason why it
    sucks is I just haven't learned how to make it better yet.

-   [How I lost my faith (very long) - comp.lang.lisp | Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.lisp/msg/6f75cfb5a289d3f6?pli=1)

    tags: lisp, python, code, programming, software

    I can't really go into many specifics about what happened at Google
    because of confidentiality, but the upshot was this: I saw, pretty
    much for the first time in my life, people being as productive and
    more in other languages as I was in Lisp.  What's more, once I got
    knocked off my high horse (they had to knock me more than once -- if
    anyone from Google is reading this, I'm sorry) and actually bothered
    to really study some of these other languges I found **myself**
    suddenly becoming more productive in other languages than I was in
    Lisp.  For example, my language of choice for doing Web development
    now is Python.

    an efficient and expressive dynamic programming language which makes
    it an interesting framework for acoustic research, algorithmic music
    and interactive programming.

    tags: story, programming, advice, software

    Looking back at that time, the restrictions of the environment are
    the biggest single factor in bringing out the best in the people
    that worked with computers back then. Think of your programming
    career as one endless code-golf competition trying to find a way to
    get both your data and your code in memory at the same time

    ... when I finally did land my coder job that I was amazed that
    people paid me for something that I would have gladly done for free

    Creativity knows no limits in a restricted environment. But
    productivity does.

    tags: rms, life, fsf, freedom, work, software

    Of course, the best thing about working for the FSF is working for
    Richard Stallman. It is rare to find someone who puts an ethical
    cause ahead of everything else in their life. Can you think of
    anyone like that? I'm grateful for his ethical leadership, and
    hope one day to see him truly receive the recognition he deserves,
    for the freedom movement he launched.
