-   [Who-T: On commit messages](http://who-t.blogspot.in/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html)

    Any software project is a collaborative project. It has at least two
    developers, the original developer and the original developer a few
    weeks or months later when the train of thought has long left the
    station. This later self needs to reestablish the context of a
    particular piece of code each time a new bug occurs or a new feature
    needs to be implemented.

    Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can't
    avoid it completely, so our efforts should go to reducing it to as
    small as possible. Commit messages can do exactly that and as a
    result, a commit message shows whether a developer is a good
    collaborator.

    It’s your fucking life. Only you can decide what to and what not to
    do. If you’re going to be listening to every soul out there, you are
    going to lose your individuality. I say do what you want. You want
    to get married? Get married. You want to travel the world?
    Travel. You want date older men? Date. You want to have Shiney
    Ahuja’s lovechild? Have. The point is, be yourself. You can’t live
    the world through someone’s else’s dreams.
