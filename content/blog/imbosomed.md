<p class="verse">
A hug so deep,<br />
resting on him the Christ,<br />
isn't just etched<br />
unto flesh of my chest,<br />
but my heart bathes,<br />
in the beauty of His love.<br />
<br />
A close embrace,<br />
not a speck moves,<br />
the winds stand still,<br />
while my mind soars,<br />
above the skies,<br />
across the blues,<br />
within and without.<br />
</p>
