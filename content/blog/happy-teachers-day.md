Well, it turned out to be not so Happy. I came to know of this
sad news. A prof published his students' work as his own, with
no mention of their names! This guy is such a shame to his
profession! Shame!

I wonder how this guy has even been able to sleep every night.
Isn't there something called a conscience?
