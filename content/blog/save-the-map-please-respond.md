The Ministry of Home Affairs put out a [draft](http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/GeospatialBill_05052016_eve.pdf) and an RFC for a Geo-spatial bill

> To regulate the acquisition, dissemination, publication and distribution of
> geospatial information of India which is likely to affect the security,
> sovereignty and integrity of India.

Even if you put aside questions about how a vetting process, for "dealing with"
any geospatial information, would help with the said goals, the bill defines
_geospatial information_ so broadly that even taking a geo-tagged picture at
the Taj mahal or sharing the location of your house for a meal delivery would
have you breaking the law.

A group of volunteers made [Save the map](http://savethemap.in) which has more information on this,
along with a draft response that you can send to the Ministry.  Please respond
before June 2nd, 2016.
