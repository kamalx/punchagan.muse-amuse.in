-   [Foundations of Data Science](https://research.microsoft.com/en-US/people/kannan/book-no-solutions-aug-21-2014.pdf)

    These notes are a first draft of a book being written by Hopcroft and Kannan
    and in many places are incomplete. However, the notes are in good enough
    shape to prepare lectures for a modern theoretical course in computer
    science. Please do not put solutions to exercises online as it is important
    for students to work out solutions for themselves rather than copy them from
    the internet.
