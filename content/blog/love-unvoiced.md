<br />
Hard, I tried, to stay mum,<br />
and keep it all within.<br />
But, not much longer can I stand,<br />
I give in, and here's my song<br />
<br />
wherever you are, anywhere you go,<br />
whatever you do, or choose not to,<br />
whatever you think and however you feel,<br />
my love for you, it shall only grow.<br />
<br />
Sweet, is the attachment,<br />
but let it not keep you from flying.<br />
the clear open sky, it's all yours<br />
fly! fly! fly!<br />
<br />
see all that you want to,<br />
and do all that you'd like to.<br />
to your hearts content, fly!<br />
without a care in the world, fly!<br />
<br />
for, if ever, you wish to rest,<br />
now you know, where to return<br />
right here, I shall be,<br />
with love, just a little more.<br />
<br />
Mute, I chose to be, but, boy!<br />
does it need to be told. All over me,<br />
it's written; and you, sure, read me!<br />
Love you, for being the more loving one!<br />
<br />
