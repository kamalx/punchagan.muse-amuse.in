-   [Replacing \`import\` with \`accio\`: A Dive into Bootstrapping and Python's Grammar](http://mathamy.com/import-accio-bootstrapping-python-grammar.html)

    At Hacker School, I've been building an alternate universe Python by
    overwriting builtin functions and statements with Harry Potter
    spells.

    “The first time people come out for dark skies, and we get Bortle
    Class 1 and 2 here, it affects them deeply,” Carroll said. “They’re
    blown away. The connection with the stars is inside all of us, but
    it has been sequestered away.”

-   [Git is a purely functional data structure – Jayway](http://www.jayway.com/2013/03/03/git-is-a-purely-functional-data-structure/)

    Git can be accurately understood as a fairly simple functional data
    structure. Instead of explaining Git in terms version control, we
    can see the ability to do version control as an emergent property of
    using that data structure. I think talking about Git in this manner
    will more accurately convey the simplicity and power of Git better
    than any comparisons with centralized version control systems can
    accomplish.

-   [Python’s Innards: Introduction | NIL: .to write(1) ~ <about>](http://tech.blog.aknin.name/2010/04/02/pythons-innards-introduction/)

    This post marks the beginning of what should develop to a series on
    Python’s internals, I’m writing it since I believe that explaining
    something is the best way to grok it, and I’d very much like to be
    able to visualize more of Python’s ‘funky green gibberish soup’ as I
    read Python code.

-   [My Rust OS will never be finished (and it's a success!) - Julia Evans](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/03/21/my-rust-os-will-never-be-finished/)

    Not finishing your project doesn’t mean it’s not a success. It
    depends what your goals are the for the project! I wrote an
    operating system in Rust to learn, and I learned a ton. It’s not
    finished, and it won’t be.
