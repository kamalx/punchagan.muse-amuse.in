Well, as you can see, I've changed my blog a bit.  I had been
trying to make it gel well with org-mode and looking for ways to
allow me to share arbit stuff with separate feeds for tags,
separate pages with independent feeds, etc.

I finally got around to tweaking the code of reprise to be able to
do this.  There are still a few things I would like to change, but
I'll make the changes gradually.  The looks are also straight from
uddegal's [[reprise, with a few tiny tweaks.  I hope it is alright
to be using it.  I really liked the theme.

Every tag now has a separate feed. `/tags/emacs.atom` will give
you the feed of `emacs` for instance. Also, I plan to have a
couple of more pages, one for all the interesting links I come
across and another for interesting quotes.  Both of these pages,
have their own feeds too (`quotes.atom` and `links.atom`).

In the spirit of minimalism, I got rid of comments.  I've been
looking for ways of having comments without all the javascript
cruft from disqus, but I didn't find any satisfactory way to do
this.  So, the site will have no comments.  You can write to me,
in case you've something to say to me.

Adios.
