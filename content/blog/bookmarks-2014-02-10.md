-   [Line Removal](http://www.leptonica.com/line-removal.html)

    Here is an interesting exercise in grayscale image processing, The
    goal is to remove some (nearly) horizontal lines from a scanned
    image, so that it is not obvious that the lines were ever there. The
    image is a pencil drawing that has relatively light pencil marks
    over dark lines that were printed on a ruled pad. The subject is

    So many books, so little time. With this in mind, the Amazon Books
    editors set out to compile a list of 100 Books to Read in a
    Lifetime. We had a few goals when we started out: We wanted the list
    to cover all stages of a life (which is why you'll find children's
    books in here), and we didn't want the list to feel like
    homework. Of course, no such list can be comprehensive – our lives,
    we hope, are long and varied – but we talked and argued and sifted
    and argued some more and came up with a list, our list, of
    favorites.

    Do whatever you want.

    Don't take VC because Twitter did. Don't piss off investors because

    idea. Do what you love.

    What's the worst that can happen? You'll fail?
