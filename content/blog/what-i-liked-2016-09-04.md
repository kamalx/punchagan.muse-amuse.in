This week was a busy one, and I didn't really consume too much web content.

A colleague mentioned that he was reading the book -- [The Millennial Project: Colonizing
the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps](https://www.amazon.com/Millennial-Project-Colonizing-Galaxy-Eight/dp/0316771651/)  and it seemed to have some interesting ideas
that I've never come across before.

The [Berklee Indian Ensemble](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=berklee+indian+ensemble) performed at the [Bengaluru Ganesh Utsava](http://www.bgu.co.in/) and I went
along with [Sunil](https://twitter.com/Sunil_santiago) to their performance, which we thoroughly loved.

I liked some of [Chet Baker instrumentals](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=chet+baker+instrumental) that I listened to this week.
