I have been reading a bunch of articles on the SuperMemo site (including the
[original thesis](http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol.htm) of P. A. Wozniack, the creator of SuperMemo).  I initially
started off trying to understand the algorithms SM2,5 and 8 which org-drill
implements, but reading the articles has given me a lot of general background
and theory on how memory works, and why SuperMemo is as effective as it is (for
those who stick with it).  This blog post is an attempt to summarize and
capture what I have read in all those [articles](http://www.supermemo.com/english/contents.htm), and not get lost in them.  I
would recommend reading the thesis and the suggested reading there, yourself,
but if you really don't want to -- this blog post + the summary in [here](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm#Prioritize), and
[here](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/decalog.htm#decalog) would be a good alternative.

-   Memory works by repetition.  Each time you recall a fact, the time it takes
    for the memory to fade increases.  Spaced repetition is the idea of repeating
    items, just when you are about to forget them -- trying to optimize the time
    spent on learning, as well as the retention of learned material.

-   Prioritization of the items we need to learn is key to being able to stick to
    Spaced repetition.  Beginners tend to be over-enthusiastic about the
    technique and fill up their system with stuff that they don't really care
    about.  Applicability of the knowledge you are trying to gain, is a good test
    for whether or not it goes into your system.

-   Each version of SuperMemo comes with a slightly modified (on most occassions,
    improved!) algorithm.  SM2, SM5, ... refer to these algorithms. Org-drill
    currently supports only sm2,5 and 8.  It may be worth looking at sm15/16 and
    seeing if it can be implemented and is worth doing.  In any case, using any
    of these is **way** better than not using Spaced repetition at all.

-   Understanding what we are trying to learn goes a long way in helping
    memory. It is, therefore, good to start with basic material. People have been
    surprised by how easily the advanced stuff fell into place, once they had the
    basics covered.

-   Keep items in the system simple.  Stick to the minimum information
    principle.  Keeping it simple, doesn't mean you leave out on learning the
    complex stuff; instead break it into simpler components.  Simpler items has
    the following advantages:
    -   Simple is easier to remember.
    -   Simpler items are easier to schedule.  You get more resolution to figure
        out what the problem areas are.
    -   Simple makes brings in redundancy automatically.  And [redundancy is good](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Redundancy_is_good)
        for memory, just like it is for managing hardware failure.

-   Keep learning fun!  Don't make review sessions a chore.  Think about the
    material you are reviewing. Edit/delete/improve items based on your reviews,
    then and there. Stay active.

-   It is useful to add a link to the source of the items added to your system,
    considering that you wish to use the system over a long period of time
    (ideally, the rest of your life!)

-   Prioritize, add examples, appeal to your emotional state, link to existing
    knowledge, use images. Anything else that works for you!  Use all of these
    techniques, that work well and you probably already use in everyday life, in
    the items you add to your system, to make them easier to recall.

-   Being physically fit and healthy is important for being so
    mentally. Exercise, sleep, eat well, avoid caffeine.

-   Try [incremental](http://www.supermemo.com/help/read.htm) [reading](http://www.supermemo.com/articles/devour.htm), as an input source of items into your memory system.
