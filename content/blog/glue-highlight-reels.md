As a leader on my Ultimate team, I spend a lot of time talking to my team mates.
I get to hear out their complaints, their joys and everything in between. All
these conversations got me thinking about what makes someone feel like an
integral part of the team, where they are making a meaningful contribution.


## Metrics to measure contribution {#metrics-to-measure-contribution}

How do we measure our contributions to the team. What do we look at, to tell
ourselves and others, whether we have made a contribution or not? I'm still
trying to make sense of this, but here are a few metrics I found.


### Highlight or Debacle reels {#highlight-or-debacle-reels}

A lot of us tend to remember things as highlight or debacle reels - we make
stories out of these events. If you got that layout grab or D, you tend to
remember it and that leaves you with a feeling of satisfaction. If you've more
highlights to remember than the number of debacles, you feel like you made a
positive contribution.

But, I think games are not as "eventful" as we think [citation needed!] --
especially when a team is playing good Ultimate. When everyone is making good
decisions and executing them well, the game is quite uneventful. The credit for
the success is distributed over the team, rather than one or two individuals.
Are we capable of identifying this, acknowledging it as a meaningful personal
contribution?


### Tiredness {#tiredness}

When we are done with a day's play, we only have a few moments stuck in our
memory. What remains as a physical manifestation is how tired we are, physically
and mentally. A lot of us tend to use this metric, probably even subconsciously.

But, with a big enough squad that is being rotated well, I'm not sure this is a
good metric.


### MVP awards {#mvp-awards}

At the end of every game, teams have a spirit circle where they discuss each
others' play, and pick a player in the opposition who made a difference to the
game - Most Valuable Player. Being identified the MVP is definitely one of the
easiest things that is used as a metric for contribution. Only one person gets
it in a game, and often, the same person gets it in a few matches over the
course of a tournament.

Sure, the MVP played well, but what about the dozen others? If you weren't the
best player, doesn't mean you didn't make a difference. Would not being
identified by the opposition make you forget those contributions? Is there
something the team can do to help recognize and identify them?


### Being Challenged {#being-challenged}

When a game was very challenging, win or loss, people tend to feel happy and
satisfied about it.

Just being challenged to their limits seems to make people feel like they have
contributed. Or may be just makes them forget about asking this question.


### Contributing in other ways {#contributing-in-other-ways}

If I'm not having a good day, or I'm injured, I don't mind filling water bottles
and taking it easy. If I've been able to alert someone from the sideline and
they make a difference, that's a contribution I'm making.


## Better metrics {#better-metrics}


### Stats {#stats}

Stats might help in a small way. For instance, just using a rotating scheme for
calling lines, a lot of the not-enough game time problems seemed to go away.
Just being able to assure people that there's a system in place to ensure they
get enough game time, took their minds away from it.

The usual kinds of stats - scores, assists, drops, etc. - might actually only
end-up reinforcing the outlook of highlight and debacle reels. But, it may help
with triggering some faded memories, which might alter the story we make up from
the events recorded.

I wonder, though, if there can be other kinds of metrics that might help bring
out some of the "grind" aspects of the game, rather than events. These stats
will be harder to collect, but would there be a way to reward someone on how
well they made space for the next cutter, or how they shutdown the person they
were defending and took them out of the game?


### Culture {#culture}

I am beginning to think the problem is primarily cultural. In a world where we
care so much about the number of likes and retweets, I think it's just hard to
remember the "grind".

Sarah Griffith [shared an interesting idea](https://soundcloud.com/user-809702254/why-every-team-needs-glue-by-surge-griffith) that she calls Glue players - players
who just do the basics right, and aren't necessarily involved in spectacles like
a layout D or a super difficult throw.

[Matty Tsang is a great coach](http://weheartmatty.tumblr.com/) who has some revolutionary ideas on how to play and
coach Ultimate. I'm not surprised the idea of glue plays goes back to him.

But, as a team without a non-playing coach, I wonder how to bring about this
culture of identifying and encouraging glue players. May be having a handful of
players who make it their job to do this for a few weeks or months, will set the
ball rolling.

Sarah has some advice on how to go about doing this in her article.

The idea of "Glue highlights" replacing the (figurative) highlight reels seems
like a very promising idea. I'd like to give this a shot, as a team!
