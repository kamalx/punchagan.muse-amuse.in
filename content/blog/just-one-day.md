<p class="verse">
The ripples on the quiet lake,<br />
twinkling stars on a moonless night,<br />
and his lonely, crazy, thoughts,<br />
yet again, his faithful companions<br />
on another of those countless nights,<br />
searching for meaning, awaiting the dawn.<br />
<br />
the night crawled by, as he drifted afloat,<br />
memories of the past and dreams of the future,<br />
until approaching footsteps, brought him back<br />
did the chill of the wind, get to his head?<br />
or was his guarded secret, not his anymore?<br />
<br />
Before his thoughts, collect, he could,<br />
his friend, from far away lands unknown,<br />
was there with him, to share his thoughts,<br />
to hear the wind hum the tunes of yore,<br />
while the stars and the lake, as a duo, danced.<br />
<br />
They watch the sun rise, from atop the hillock,<br />
basking in the warmth, and see the town wake up,<br />
lose themselves in the woods below,<br />
on their way back, rest by the lake shore,<br />
watching it, silently, shine in the daylight,<br />
letting it wet their feet and clear his head.<br />
<br />
Together, they cook themselves, a delicious meal,<br />
n enjoy it, with some of the choicest old wine.<br />
Catch-up on things, and yearn for more, discuss<br />
all the many things, under the sun, and over,<br />
without a clue, as to how much time flew by.<br />
<br />
Riding away, as fast as they could, they reach,<br />
just in time, as the sun set, over the seas,<br />
perched on bicycles, in mirrored positions, with<br />
resonating thoughts, the horizon, they watch<br />
the sun set, the beach light up, and the fair begin.<br />
<br />
They ate and drank, sung and danced and<br />
just had a good time, for the rest of the night,<br />
indulging, in all that the fair could offer.<br />
the night was long, but if wouldn't go on forever,<br />
pretty well, they knew, they day was to end.<br />
<br />
the twinkling stars they watched, yet again,<br />
but to the sea's song, on the still warm sand<br />
slowly, but steadily, into sleep he drifted,<br />
only to be awake, moments later, with the<br />
bright sun coming harshly down upon him,<br />
lighting up the lake, like a carpet of jewels.<br />
<br />
all he had, once again, were just his thoughts,<br />
the lake, and not the sea, by his side,<br />
with fading impressions of an impossible dream<br />
after all, wasn't it just too much action,<br />
for just one day, for a life engulfed by ennui?<br />
<br />
One some day, he told himself, and walked away.<br />
