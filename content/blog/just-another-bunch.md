Come spring -<br />
a fresh lease of green<br />
drapes the bare branches.<br />
<br />
The leaves, dancing and whistling<br />
to the tunes of the wind<br />
playing, screaming, and singing,<br />
in each other's company, enjoying.<br />
<br />
Singing to one another<br />
promises of sticking together,<br />
come what may, through it all.<br />
<br />
The song goes on,<br />
but the count goes down,<br />
not noticed or just unacknowledged,<br />
first by one and then by many more.<br />
<br />
the song, still, goes on.<br />
And the promises too, of course.<br />
The song goes on and on and on.<br />
<br />
Until silence falls upon, when all<br />
of them are gone. The tree, knowing well,<br />
watches on - it won't be long before<br />
a new bunch springs up to sing the song.<br />
