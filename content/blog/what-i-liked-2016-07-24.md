This week was relatively quiet for me.  But, here's what I liked, mostly from
my twitter timeline.  If you follow me on twitter, there may not be anything
new for you.

This [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy088gyClIc) on how Nima made it to Ultimate's most prestigious tournament
made me cry each time I watched it.  And movies/videos rarely make me cry.

Sacha Chua [writes](http://sachachua.com/blog/2016/03/microphthalmia-small-eye/) about her baby's Microphthalmia and says this -- "She'll make
an awesome pirate. Or cyborg. Or cyborg pirate. If she wants."  Woah!

I discovered [Rains Of Castamere by Krish Ashok](https://soundcloud.com/krishashok/rains-of-castamere) and loved it. Some looping
happened!

@varungrover wrote [argued](https://twitter.com/varungrover/status/759034413040607232/photo/1) for using better insults than 'Presstitue' and I
agree. I have had similar thoughts on the other insults he talks about.

[This tweet thread](https://twitter.com/aishu_s/status/759062643361533952) got me thinking about speaking up, and standing up, and how
people fail to do it, and what could help prevent these failures.

[This picture](https://twitter.com/nidsitis/status/758912332936323072/photo/1) of kids praying at Haji Public School gave me hope.
