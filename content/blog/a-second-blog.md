-   It can't really be called a Second Blog... because I won't be
    posting any new stuff there...
-   I just started it to have a Wordpress experience...
-   I started it to know.. to compare... and to choose...
-   I started it just for fun...
-   I started it because Blogspot may soon be blocked on campus!!!
