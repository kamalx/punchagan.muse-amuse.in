-   [Groklaw - 1 + 1 (pat. pending) — Mathematics, Software and Free Speech](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20110426051819346)

    tags: freedom, math, software

    This article provides a detailed factual explanation of why
    software is mathematics, complete with the references in
    mathematical and computer science literature. It also includes a
    detailed factual explanation of why mathematics is speech,
    complete once again with references. My hope is that it will help
    patent lawyers and judges handling patent litigation understand
    these fundamental truths, so they can apply that technical
    knowledge to their field of skill.

    The important distinction is whether you risked everything, put
    your life on the line, made commitments to investors, employees,
    customers and friends, and tried – against all the forces in the
    world that try to keep new ideas down – to make something new.

-   [What is Coq ? | The Coq Proof Assistant](http://coq.inria.fr/what-is-coq)

    tags: programming, langugage, math, software

    Coq allows:

    -   to define functions or predicates, that can be evaluated efficiently;
    -   to state mathematical theorems and software specifications;
    -   to interactively develop formal proofs of these theorems;
    -   to machine-check these proofs by a relatively small certification "kernel";
    -   to extract certified programs to languages like Objective Caml, Haskell or Scheme.

    tags: work, advice, insight, howto, hack

    For the first couple years you make stuff, it's just not that good. It's trying to be good, it has potential, but it's not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you.
