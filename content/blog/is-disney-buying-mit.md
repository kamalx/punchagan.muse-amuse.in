On April Fools Day of 1998, hackers broke into the MIT web server
and changed the MIT home page to indicate that The Walt Disney
Company had purchased MIT for $6.9 billion.

The hacked page contained a link fake to a press release titled
_Walt Disney Corporation to Acquire MIT for $6.9 Billion_.

Later that day the MIT News Office issued a press release titled
_MIT says "Disney buys MIT" hack revealed by low price_
