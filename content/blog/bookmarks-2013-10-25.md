-   [Cricket-Talket: Playing Against Rahul Dravid](http://crickettalket.blogspot.in/2013/10/playing-against-rahul-dravid.html)

    it is not every day that you get to play against someone with 13000
    Test runs. It is not every day that you get to play against someone
    you have adored and idolised since the first time you saw him. It is
    not every day that you play against Rahul Dravid!

-   [Why Python is Better than Matlab for Scientific Software | Meta Rabbit](http://metarabbit.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/why-python-is-better-than-matlab-for-scientific-software/)

    If you have legacy code in MATLAB, then it may make sense to just
    continue using it. If it works, don’t fix it. However, if your

    We're one month into the second year of Catalyst, an after-school
    tech/computer class that I run for kids aged 9-13, and this year
    I've decided to try something different. [Last year, I had the kids
    learn in a browser-based / console-like IDE that I created - kind of
    like CodeAcademy, but ultimately it was just too much work to
    maintain and too limiting]. My new plan is to teach the kids how to
    build their own interactive websites from scratch using HTML, CSS
    and Javascript, and to do it on their own Linux VPS (CentOS 6) using
    Vim. I know it probably sounds crazy, but if the preliminary
    reception and results are any indication, I think it's going to be a
    success.

    ride through Ladakh, trekking through the valley of flowers in
    Himalayas to surfing in Orissa, here are some insane experiences.
