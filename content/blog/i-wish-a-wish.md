On a day, Wonderful,<br />
'm filled with emotion<br />
inexpressible<br />
for, I think of<br />
all that we share.<br />
<br />
On a day that's Special,<br />
for the World,<br />
not just yet may be,<br />
my heart rejoices<br />
in the light you fill me with.<br />
<br />
On a day, epochal<br />
I just hope, you enjoy<br />
all that the World's given<br />
and celebrate for<br />
all the difference you make<br />
in the World of some.<br />
<br />
On this day,<br />
overwhelmed, with lots to convey,<br />
silence, I choose,<br />
for, it speaks louder than words.<br />
I just say,<br />
Happy Birthday, mate.<br />

my 50th post; A poem, I wrote a few weeks ago; A poem or is it doggerel?;
Something I wrote for a chum, that gives me courage to write more.
