I had problems with this and tried quite a few things to get it
working...  [uninstalling and re-installing
packages... downloading fonts.. etc.. ] but couldn't until I found
help here...

[Apparently there's a bug in the Pothana font (in Feisty)]

[ Don't worry if you can't figure out what's the big deal in
linking to an already existing post.. :P]
