-   [Learning to Code vs Learning Computer Science ← Terence Eden's Blog](http://shkspr.mobi/blog/2014/02/learning-to-code-vs-learning-computer-science/)

    Learning to code is merely teaching people to spell.

    Computer Science is about what makes a poem beautiful, why
    alliteration is alluring, how iambic pentameter unlocks the secrets
    of Shakespeare.

-   [Need a Project Idea? Scratch Your Own Itch](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/01/28/need-a-project-idea-scratch-your-own-itch/)

    how do you determine a need that isn't being fulfilled and might be
    the basis for a project/business? Two ways. You could ask people
    what problems they have that you might be able to help solve, or
    (for introverts like me) examine what processes or services feel
    needlessly difficult in your own life.

-   [Generating a portrait from a hair: The work of Heather Dewey-Hagborg | TED Blog](http://blog.ted.com/2013/06/20/generating-a-sculpture-from-a-hair-the-work-of-heather-dewey-hagborg/)

    Dewey-Hagborg’s work is super interesting, not to mention searingly
    contemporary. “It’s a very accessible way for the public to engage
    with this new technology. It really brings to light how powerful it
    is, the idea that a hair from your head can fall on your street and
    a perfect stranger can pick it up and know something about it,” she
    says, adding: “With DNA sequencing becoming faster and cheaper, this
    is the world we’re all going to be living in.”

-   [paperplanes. A Standing Desk Love Affair](http://www.paperplanes.de/2014/2/10/standing-desk.html)

    Standing up all day can be tough at first, but I'm much happier
    working like that. Plus, when you finally switch off at night,
    you'll feel like you've done more than just think and type.

-   [OUseful Info: The Cost of Meetings - How Much Return on Investment Do YOU Get?](http://ouseful.open.ac.uk/blogarchive/014885.html)

    If the counter is displayed during the meeting, then everyone can
    decide whether or not the meeting is generating a sensible
    return. Whoever has the courage to call off a meeting on the grounds
    it probably isn't worth it should get 10% of the expected meeting
    costs saved to spend on a project of their choice (no meetings
    allowed ;-).

-   [5 Ways To Burn Out Programming](http://blog.braegger.pw/5-ways-to-burn-out-programming/)

    In short, it's easy to burnout. Do these 5 things, and you can
    burnout too.
