At my [$dayjob](http://enthought.com), for the most part of October, I had the fortune of
pair programming with [Martin](https://plus.google.com/114995175796183910458/posts) and it was an amazing learning
experience!  To share these lessons with my colleagues, I made a small
presentation at lunch, to my colleagues.  [Here are the slides](https://rawgithub.com/punchagan/340e1350fdfc766c6599/raw/ca1f5fe9bfc1cc503cd8a524e350bd29e8f5f33d/month-with-martin.html) for the
presentation.
