-   [The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better Code - Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html)

    tags: code, work, software

    The neat thing about The Joel Test is that it's easy to get a quick yes or no to each question. You don't have to figure out lines-of-code-per-day or average-bugs-per-inflection-point. Give your team 1 point for each "yes" answer. The bummer about The Joel Test is that you really shouldn't use it to make sure that your nuclear power plant software is safe.
