[Great visualizations](http://www.indiaspend.com/cover-story/cool-data-visualisation-reveals-extent-of-global-warming-28723) about how global temperatures have been changing in the
last ~165 years.  If you are still a global warming skeptic, you definitely
must see them.

[These visualizations](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/09/sports/olympics/2016-08-09-olympics-phelps-vs-phelps.html) of Michael Phelps' performances at Olympics over the years
by NYTimes are great, too!

I came across these delightful videos ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XatrFO1N0gY), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQtuJnS5lPQ)) of girls and boys playing cricket
at Haji Public School.  Look ma, no sexism in [coverage of sports](http://theladiesfinger.com/tata-salt-ad-babita-kumari/).

This (Telugu) interview of Dr Jayaprakash Narayan is [truly inspiring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKF_HqEXLZI).  Also,
YouTube recommended his [conversation with Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyr31JYwftI), which was
unexpectedly insightful, and covers a wide variety of topics -- spirituality,
religion, social organizations, politics, socialism vs. capitalism.
