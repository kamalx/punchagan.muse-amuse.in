Should one take the easy route of asking someone who knows, if she
is sitting right next to you? Or should we try and find out first,
before asking her? Should one value his time more than others' or
others' time more than his own?

Would we learn more if we tried to find out ourselves? Does
learning more, make sense? Is it worth spending the extra time?

I'm just talking of simple things that you could figure out by
spending a couple of minutes of searching the web or 5 minutes of
thinking or 10 minutes of reading a book.
