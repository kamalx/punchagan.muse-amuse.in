These days my strolls, in the blog-o-sphere, have grown manifold
both in their numbers and lengths. And with every passing
step... self doubts mount up. I begin to wonder if my blogs even
worth its w8 in 'seconds'. Like the thousands of others in this
world, I could post something in one of these genres but..

-   Techno Blog. [On various latest hardware, softwares, gadgets et
    al..] But I ain't a geek to be able to post such stuff. If I
    ever posted something of this genre.. it would just be a
    copy-paste job.. isn't of any great value, given the readership
    of my blog.
-   Scientific Blog. [With the latest advances in various
    disciplines of Science] Again a case similar to the previous
    one. Not of much use
-   Literary Blog.[Stories n Poems n other Creations.] I ain't a
    creative being and rarely indulge in such creative acts. Would
    be foolish
-   PhotoBlog.[Creative Pics/Paintings, Worthy of Display] I own no
    camera and don't borrow one too often. Also haven't got a very
    Creative eye to capture magic from the ordinary. Un-healthy
-   Daily Diary. [An account of my day-to-day tidings] My life ain't
    overflowing with adventures. I am presently leading a
    non-adventurous, pretty monotonous life that would be
    uninteresting to readers of all classes. Ruled out for the lack
    of utility.
-   Current-affairs Blog. [An account of today's, this week's
    happenings] Not interested in being a Journalist, there's
    already lotsa people who can handle the job better.
-   Humour Blog. [Laugh and Let Laugh!] Again there's a lot of it
    already online, and with a sense of humour like mine, the
    difference made would be Nought.
-   Inspirational Blog. [Inspire others to do their best.] Its
    pointless preaching what I don't practice. That would be
    hypocrisy.
-   Information Blog. [Any info possibly..from pet-care to ethnic
    goan recipes...] I haven't yet crammed in so much into the
    super-computer on my top-floor to beat Google.
-   A Mixed Bag. [Posts of multiple genres] Impossible. The bag's
    already empty for every item of it has already been ruled out.

Do I still need a BLOG?

ps: Prevention of boredom-induced-insanity is the one and only
genuine reason(known to me) for the continued existence of my
blog.
