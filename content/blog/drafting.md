Drafting behind trucks (when cycling) could be a great energy
saver.  I came across this idea when reading up a blog post by a
cyclist.

The idea is similar to birds flying in a V-shape to get a greater
lift.  While drafting, the goal is to reduce the drag force.

Pacelines in cycling races are formed precisely for this reason.
This page has a short summary of what drafting is all about.

Should be trying this out, the next time around.
