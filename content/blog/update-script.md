Well, this isn't an update of how I'm doing on my sabbatical. Its
just been 3 days and I'm doing pretty fine.  I just finished
writing a script to keep my blogs page in sync with my
google-reader (well not exactly). The script parses an xml export
of my google-reader-subscriptions and updates the edits the html
of my unnought-blogs page. period.

There are a couple of things I don't like about this script.

Firstly, I don't want to keep exporting my
google-reader-subscription each time I make changes. The script
should be able to directly sync with my google-reader without me
having to export the file.  [I have read about the atom
subscriptions feed of Google Reader, but haven't been able to get
it right.] Hopefully, I'll be able to do it in the near future.

Secondly, The blog author's name is non-existent. I can't do
anything about this though.

Also, In the process, I had the chance to look a geeky ad. I found
it at the weirdest of places!
