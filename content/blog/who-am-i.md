<p class="verse">
dead and lifeless, in a box I lie<br />
just my size, to be buried deep somewhere,<br />
arranged with flowers, bright and fragrant<br />
more alive than dead, are they<br />
the final goodbye I have said,<br />
gone am I, never to return--but<br />
who am I, who am I, who am I?<br />
<br />
am I --<br />
the knowledge I arduously gained,<br />
from all the books I read and re-read.<br />
the wealth and riches I made,<br />
at the cost of sweat, often also blood.<br />
the skill with utmost care I groomed,<br />
for that, today, has me world-renowned.<br />
the numerous battles I braved,<br />
where win or loss never, only a fight mattered.<br />
all those dreams I dared to dream,<br />
and the goals I never, or have, reached.<br />
<br />
None of it, I realised, am I,<br />
but, who am I, who am I, who am I<br />
deep and loud, for one last time I wonder<br />
"the difference, you make to the world,<br />
is who you are", my Master answered,<br />
"Life's fragrance is in service,<br />
it grows and unfurls, far and wide,<br />
long after you are lifeless and dead"<br />
