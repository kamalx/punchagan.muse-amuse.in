-   [It's Nice That : Bookshelf: Jason Silva](http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/bookshelf-jason-silva)

    As we prepare body and soul for the gluttony and giving nearly upon
    us, Jason Silva presents us with an intellectual antidote; an
    incredible and excitable selection of books that thinks a little
    bigger than exactly how many brussels sprouts we will be expected to

    group consciousness and technology’s expectation of us, the
    synthesis of the human condition and (why not?) immortality – all
    are to be found in the permanent pages of this wonderfully
    accessible selection of books on Silva’s Bookshelf.
