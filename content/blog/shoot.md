I've been caught "shooting" with a camera and looked upon as
'terrorist' material. Not once or twice, but 4 times, at 3
different places, by different people. Friends with "pro" cameras
(or pro-looking ones) have been stopped on quite a few occasions
being mistaken for reporters. I'm not talking of those
instances. I am counting the times when I've been in "real"
trouble and was treated as a potential terrorist. Four Times.

The last time was special, since I was robbed of cash by a Public
servant in the 'Khakhi', who was apparently doing his duties! I
leave the cribbing about corrupt men and lost cash for later. It
obviously didn't feel nice, being treated in that fashion.

And that, just for having a camera and trying to learn the art of
"shooting" pictures. Thankfully, it was something that I could,
shut off (along with my mouth) and throw into my backpack.

What of people born to parents who believe in a particular
god. People suspected for what their parents named them. People
suspected for dressing the way their fathers and mothers and
brothers and sisters dress.

Wonder when the world 'll grow up...
