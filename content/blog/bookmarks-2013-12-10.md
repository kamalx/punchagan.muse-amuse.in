    So if you donate those football tickets to some fans who were
    willing to sit out in the snow for hours, you’d feel better about
    staying in bed and watching the game on television.

-   [Chernobyl’s Hot Mess, “the Elephant’s Foot,” Is Still Lethal - Facts So Romantic - Nautilus](http://nautil.us/blog/chernobyls-hot-mess-the-elephants-foot-is-still-lethal)

    Born of human error, continually generating copious heat, the
    Elephant’s Foot is still melting into the base of the Chernobyl
    nuclear power plant. If it hits ground water, it could trigger
    another catastrophic explosion or leech radioactive material into
    the water nearby residents drink. Long after bleeding from the core,
    this unique piece of waste continues to be a testament to the
    potential dangers of nuclear power. The Elephant’s Foot will be
    there for centuries, sitting in the dark basement of a concrete and
    steel sarcophagus, a symbol of one of humankind’s most powerful
    tools gone awry.

    So stop kidding yourself year after year. Stop expecting a start and
    fearing an end. If you’ve read this, your journey has already
    begun. Where you go from here is your call. But do what it
    takes. Make it happen.

-   [A Formula That Shows How to Cheat & Triumph at Tournaments - Facts So Romantic - Nautilus](http://nautil.us/blog/a-formula-that-shows-how-to-cheat--triumph-at-tournaments)

    I told you before that the purpose of mathematics is insight, but I
    think I lied. Even more than that, the reason I do math is the
    excitement and uncertainty of the chase. There is no joy in applying
    a computer algorithm, but there is joy in unlocking the delicate
    clockwork mechanism that makes a good math problem tick. And, in the
    end, you just might learn something that nobody else in the world
    knows!

    … Oh, and by the way, I really don’t believe that honesty is merely
    a wasted opportunity to cheat. I said that just for effect. Honest.
