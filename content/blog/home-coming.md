I'll be on board the Amaravathi Express in less than three hours
from now! Bags packed, I'm waiting for the sun to rise, the World
to wake up.

I have set my self an objective of completing 40 problems from
Project Euler. I have done 39. [With exams going on I consider it
good progress] I will be attempting to push off the last one
before leaving. Here I come, Project Euler. Here I come,
Hyderabad!
