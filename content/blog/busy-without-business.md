Yes, that's what my PS's been like.. It hasn't turned out to be as
great a learning experience as one would imagine it to be..  [or
atleast I hoped, it would be...] On the contrary, its turning out
to be bad...

When I first read this {from Feynman's Cargo Cult Science [Adapted
from a Caltech commencement address in 1974]}, I couldn't quite
figure out what or how exactly things are happening and what
exactly Feynman meant by "losing the value of experiments". But,
now I know.. thanks to my PS. A lot of stuff that goes on
here..[at least from what I can see..] is quite similar to (in
fact worse than) this. PS's been absolutely disappointing.. I
don't think I've learnt anything here that's worth the effort of
spending my hols (too), away from home...  [except for Awe-TEM] I
don't think I will be taking back anything with me..  other than
may be, a knowledge of stuff that I shouldn't learn, stuff that I
should keep away for the rest of my life...

Feynman is saying this to **me**, Right now!
