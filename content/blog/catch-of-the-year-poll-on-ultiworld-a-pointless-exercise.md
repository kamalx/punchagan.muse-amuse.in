[Ultiworld](https://ultiworld.com/2019/02/19/ultiworlds-2018-catch-year-bracket-presented-friction-gloves/), a popular Ultimate related magazine did a poll for it's "readers" to
[pick the Catch of the Year](https://ultiworld.com/2019/02/19/ultiworlds-2018-catch-year-bracket-presented-friction-gloves/). I wouldn't have noticed it normally, but this time
around Pranav Rajan, a player from India, featured in it. A lot of people in the
Indian Ultimate community tried to ensure the whole community took notice and
voted in large numbers!

Studying all these hours of tape and picking some of the best catches seems like
a great contribution to the Ultimate community. It gives these players a good
platform of recognition and it also gives all of us people to look up to.

But, I find this whole exercise of popular voting quite pointless. What exactly
is Ultiworld trying to achieve here? It seems like it is just a competition to
see how much popularity and support each player can garner.

The poll is unauthenticated. People can vote multiple times, with simple cookie
tweaking. Even if we are relying on people to vote in the ["Spirit of the Game"](http://wfdf.org/sotg/about-sotg),
I don't see what the community gains out of this exercise.

The players, who featured in the poll, themselves are left wondering if they
deserved to win given the poll wasn't fool-proof and given that humans with all
their biases easily vote for players they know, or players from their country,
etc.

Ultiworld gets lots of page views and the like. The link to the vote was shared
with lots of people who probably hadn't heard of Ultiworld before or don't care
to read it. May be they found a few new readers?

I would've liked the whole exercise a lot more if Ultiworld just stopped at
picking the 8 or 16 top catches, and putting them all in a post. But, may be
that wouldn't have got so many page views!

I refuse to participate in any such future popularity contests. And I think we
all should.
