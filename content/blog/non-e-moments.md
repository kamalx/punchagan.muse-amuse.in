A few days back.. we [the usual gang of Ringo,9,UC,Vudum n
me.. along with a lot of others who joined us later] were in the
park, just relaxing and having a chat... but with the others
joining us [with whom I usually don't hang around..] , the topics
discussed were quite different from those that interest me...and
we usually talk on..  I was getting bored.. but suddenly an
interesting idea popped up... the funda of living on CS.. [though
the tone in which they looked at the idea was different... I found
it interesting..]

The ppl were criticizing a guy (don't wanna name him :P) {who
hosted wierd maps with soccer and other such stuff in it..}.. the
people were imagining wild things like.. maps in which class-notes
would be read out/scrolled... maps where food items would be
displayed at lunch time.. etc.. This might look like a funny and
weird idea.. (that gave us all a nice laugh..) but it doesn't seem
ridiculous or crazy to me.. the very fact that the idea was
conceived, annihilates it ridiculousness, for me. Though such a
degree of dependence (and addiction??) may be an over exaggeration
but...

A walk in the hostel corridors any time during the night will tell
you why i say this... I can see people in every room... (literally
every one.. and mind you I am no exception to this..) stuck to
their comps doing all sorts of things... [actually not a wide
range.. its pretty predictable... :-(] and now after my comp's
network card got burnt out (...probably... thanks to the lack of
grounding in hostels) I can see it even more clearly... that
computers are ruling our lives... [at this point.. I'm confused
why I started writing this... what's it that's bugging me? I'm
definitely not against ppl using Comps.. for I love them...]

Is it that it pains me to see people use comps for stuff that's
not so technical? Does it hurt me that we have such "Powerful"
machines before us.. and all we do with them is trivial things
like chat with others or play? I don't think so... Yes, when I
read the book Hackers:Heroes of the Computer Revolution, I felt
ashamed of using my comp in a meek and powerless way... but then I
realise that they were the Hackers from the Hacker land .. and
everyone can't be one, can they? Then what's it, that bugs me?

I guess I miss the time we spent in the first (and a little of
second) semester... when very few people had comps. We had a great
time... doing other activities that were more physical... and
refreshing (than sitting in front of a comp and posting
this!!).. I miss those football tourneys we had in the
quadrangles.. I miss those "leg" cricket matches... I long for
something like the Wrestling match we [Vudum, Ravi,Thatha n me]
had in my room... I miss those thermo sessions with Vudum n
Ravi.. I miss the tuts in Ravi's room... (mind you we sometimes
studied even when there weren't exams!!) I guess I miss a lotta
things from the first sem... The time at dinner and the chats in
parks, are the only things that are still intact... [ I wouldn't
dare forget to mention our recent trip to the woods near the
lake... it was awesome!! something that we'll all cherish for
life...] I just hope we have more and more and such
moments... moments that i will cherish for life... moments.. that
"we" will cherish for life...

**Update**: I just saw Ringo's old cd of Illayaraja songs... and
 realised, I forgot to mention the wonderful time we
 [Ringo,9,Hari,UC n me..] had listening to them in Ringo's room on
 a CD player... and Ringo's mouthorgan!!!
