Writing from Delhi, doing my PS at NPL! One would imagine, that I
am here enjoying myself; that I am enjoying thoroughly the
exposure I am getting to the world of Physics at a Research Level;
that I am spending each moment, inspired. But things haven't been
so rosy here... until today! [All this while I had been only doing
a lot of mechanical labor, very unhappily...]

Its around 12 noon, when I get a call, in the lab, from my guide
asking me to come down to room no. so and so. I had no idea what
that room had, or why I had been called. I enter and I am lead to
another room inside. I enter and there's a huge machine. (first
look, reminded me of Vickers' Hardness Testing Machine, that we
had in Lab at coll and I had a test on using it!) and its called a
TEM. But when I got closer, I fell in love with it! I dunno how
and why, but it looked simply amazing and extremely lovely to me
[Nothing like the Vickers' machine]. A 25 to 30 year old machine,
lots of controls all over it, lots of circuitry out in the
open... absolutely awe-inspiring..[though I knew nothing about
them.]

And then came the moment. The lights in the room were turned off,
and slowly and steadily the beam intensity of the TEM was
increased. Gradually the Greenish Fluoroscent Screen (displaying a
sample magnified X27,000) came to life... with control lights
blinking here and there... in the darkness of the room.It was
absolutely amazing; A great feeling. Though I was in there for a
very short while... an absolutely unforgettable experience; and
will remain so, for the rest of my life.

Now, it doesn't matter to me even if I don't learn much, during
the training period, I don't mind doing any kind-of mechanical
work, I don't mind not getting any results from my work,
whatever... it doesn't matter any more. This one moment; that's
all that matters.
