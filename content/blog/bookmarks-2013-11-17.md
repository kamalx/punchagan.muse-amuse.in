    The engineering metaphor has had its time in the sun, and maybe it
    even used to be accurate, but now it really only serves to help
    non-technical people have unrealistic expectations about how
    software gets built.

    I am a Software Gardener.

-   [Meet Craig, the First Man in the World to Live Without a Heart   JacksGap](http://jacksgap.com/meet-first-heartless-man/)

    When Craig Lewis aged 55 had been diagnosed with a heart disease so
    intricate not even a pacemaker could save him, Texan doctors had to
    think outside of the box.

    Outstandingly, they developed a revolutionary concept where by they
    install a device that keeps his blood in continuous flowâ€¦without a
    pulse.

    Within a day of surgery Craig was up and speaking to doctors and now
    lives fully functioning without a heart. Who said science was
    boring?
