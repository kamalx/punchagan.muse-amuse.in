    The ideal presentation should be aimed at an audience of gentleman
    and lady programmers—smart, and generally capable but without,

-   [Summary Report: Git Repository Disruption Incident of Nov 10th | Jenkins CI](http://jenkins-ci.org/content/summary-report-git-repository-disruption-incident-nov-10th)

    As reported in various places, there was an incident in early
    November where commits in our Git repositories have become misplaced
    temporarily by accident. By the mid next week we were able to
    resurrect all the commits and things are back to normal now.

    commentary, we wrote this post to clarify what exactly happened and
    what we are doing to prevent this.

    After he stopped working earlier this year to live off the $1,300 he makes
    from his startup each month, Bohmeyer says his life has radically changed. So
    he started “My Basic Income”, a new initiative looking to raise enough money
    to pay someone $1,300 a month for a year, no strings attached.
