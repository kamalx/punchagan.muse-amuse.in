Well, I'm not sure if it's worth writing about.  I conducted my
first org-mode workshop along with Prof. Venkatesh Choppella at
IIIT-Hyderabad.  It was a 3 hour demo+talk kind of a thing, with a
small audience of about 20 people, most of whom were new to
Emacs.

We covered almost all the aspects of Org-mode after giving a brief
introduction to Emacs.  Outlining and note-taking part was simple
and easy to understand, but the audience couldn't really
appreciate the part of keeping TODO lists and agendas and other
stuff.  I'm hoping, the reason was not me taking over from
Venkatesh.

I think the workshop should've been more hands-on and we should've
asked people to try out stuff on the spot, instead of showing off
the things possible with Emacs.  They probably would've
appreciated a few things better, that way.

Hopefully, we will be doing more workshops on Org-mode and there
are surely somethings to take away from this one.  I hope at least
one of the participants, gets hooked to Org-mode.

The talk outline is here.
