I just wanted to thank Sacha Chua for bearing with my newbie elisp
code and trying out org2blog.

Also, thanks for the two patches she sent.

1.  Feature addition - Posting sub-trees instead of whole buffers.
    I had this feature in mind, and had started working on it after
    her request, but she was too quick for me! ;)
2.  Cleaning up of the code that uploads images.

I'm loving it!
