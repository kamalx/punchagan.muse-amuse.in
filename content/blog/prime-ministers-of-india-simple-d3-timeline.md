I have been working on a simple time-line showing the terms of Prime Ministers
of India. Currently, the time-line is not very useful and only shows the
duration of the term in the time0line, with some pictures, with the hover
tool-tip linking to a Wikipedia page.  The interactive version is [here](https://punchagan.github.io/data-projects/india-pm/).

A simple extension of this would be to add historical events of different types
over this time-line, with links to more information on these events. I'm not
entirely sure, where I'm going with this, though.

Any ideas and suggestions are more than welcome.
