    You are there for one reason - to train hard, and to focus on all
    the things you need to be doing right - stance, breathing, form,
    recovery, chalking up, everything - and do them right. Quit faffing
    around!

    A training session is about an hour long, of mostly lifting stuff
    and time between lifting stuff, where you recover. If this isn't
    what you do, sleeping in is a better option.

    The map, at that point, will just be data: a way for our phones,
    cars and who knows what else to navigate in the real world. Whose
    data will that be: Google’s? Ours? Our car company’s? It’s too soon
    to tell. But one thing seems certain, O’Reilly says. In the end,
    “the guy who has the most data, wins.”

-   [The One in Which I Call Out Hacker News - bitquabit](http://bitquabit.com/post/one-which-i-call-out-hacker-news/)

    The next time you see an application you like, think very long and
    hard about all the user-oriented details that went into making it a
    pleasure to use, before decrying how you could trivially reimplement
    the entire damn thing in a weekend. Nine times out of ten, when you
    think an application was ridiculously easy to implement, you’re
    completely missing the user side of the story.

-   [Houses of Goa - About the Project](http://housesofgoa.com/about.html)

    The history of Goa is intrinsically linked to the many centuries of
    Portuguese presence and rule. Before the arrival of the Portuguese,
    most Goan houses were mostly made of mud and had a thatched
    roof. They faced inwards towards a central courtyard and had small
    windows, mostly devoid of ornaments.

    The Portuguese arrived in Goa in 1510 and brought with them a host
    of cultural and aesthetic influences from Europe and other
    places. Goans who travelled abroad also returned with ideas and
    influences from other countries that they incorporated into their
    houses.

    the high that playing Ultimate Frisbee gives me, is pretty damn
    unbeatable.

    “If you want to describe a specific person in detail, I cannot do it
    in a general scheme. There is a general scheme, but there are plenty
    of specific ramifications that drive you to be the person that you
    are. For a planetary system it is the same thing. That’s chaos:
    extreme sensitivity to tiny changes.”

-   [Love at First Flight](http://vimeo.com/45798267)

    Why chase plastic for life?

    Love at First Flight is a documentary on ultimate, or rather, why
    people play ultimate. It is a documentary for non-players that tries
    to explain our passion for the sport that we love.
