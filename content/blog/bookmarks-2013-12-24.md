    Machine Learning (or ML) offers the promise of having a computer
    pour through your data and automatically extract or create the
    information that you’re interested in. At least in theory. On closer
    inspection machine learning is a loosely defined collection of
    poorly explained statistical and algorithmic tricks that are magical
    when they work and fail fantastically when they don’t. Acquiring the
    needed skills for working with data safely is not easy. So we’ve
    assembled a solid set of suggestions and resources on getting
    started.

    What I learnt in my hunter-gatherer education has been far more
    valuable to my adult life than what I learnt in school, and I think
    others in my age group would say the same if they took time to think
    about it.

-   [Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)

    Between The Great Backlash Against Waterfall Design and The Supreme
    Acceptance of Agile Development, something was lost. Don't get me
    wrong, waterfall design takes things way too far. Huge systems
    specified in minute detail end up being the WRONG systems specified
    in minute detail. We were right to strike it down. But what took its
    place is too far in the other direction. Now we have projects with
    short, badly written, or entirely missing documentation. Some
    projects don't even have a Readme!

    This is not acceptable. There must be some middle ground between
    reams of technical specifications and no specifications at all. And
    in fact there is. That middle ground is the humble Readme.

    “If you let your mind talk you out of things that aren’t logical,
    you’re going to have a very boring life. Because grace isn’t
    logical. Love isn’t logical. Miracles aren’t logical.”

    Barbra DeAngelis said that. And in one sweeping statement, she
    summed up the entirety of what I’m trying to say here.

    ...

    You are not your job, your relationship, where you live, where you
    grew up, where you went to school, what you’re passionate about,
    what you do or what you did or where you’re going or where you’ve
    been. You just are. You are your existence, you are your awareness,
    you are your consciousness.
