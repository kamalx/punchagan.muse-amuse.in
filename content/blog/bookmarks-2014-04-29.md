-   [John Resig - Write Code Every Day](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/)

    Inspired by the incredible work that Jennifer Dewalt completed last
    year, in which she taught herself programming by building 180 web
    sites in 180 days, I felt compelled to try a similar tactic: working

-   [Debug your programs like they're closed source! - Julia Evans](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/04/20/debug-your-programs-like-theyre-closed-source/)

    I've learned that I have the power to fix things around me that I
    don't like. I don't need to just deal with it because that's just
    the way things are. I have the power to shape the world around
    me. It's just a matter of believing that I can change things. Just
    believing is all I need to actually take the first step towards
    taking action.
