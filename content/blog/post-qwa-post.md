Back again with another khichdi of a post.

-   Quark, Waves and Apogee. [For the uninitiated, Quark is our
    technical festival and Waves, our Cul-fest] I had been to
    BITS-Pilani, for attending their Tech-fest, Apogee.
    -   One would expect Apogee to end up the best, but we were
        thoroughly disappointed. It came nowhere near the perfection
        of Quark and things seemed quite unprofessional. Hats-off to
        Chaitu n others in the Quark Org-Co. I'm already worried
        about missing Quark'09 [thanks to my PS]
    -   The specials at all three events were unforgettable. Feeding
        the Fish, the Air Shows (Naval and Amateur planes), the
        Orchestral performance, Special Performance [Aasra], Sand
        art by Gagan and Mithali!
    -   Had the opportunity, to meet/have a look at some of the guys
        studying at colleges in their home towns. For once, I felt
        being in a "reputed", national college does matter.
    -   Felt good spending some time with good ol' friends at
        Pilani.
    -   Always believed organizing events isn't my forte, but,
        helped organize a couple of events at Quark. Feels good.
    -   Effective Communication is less about how well you choose
        your words but more about your quantum of concern for the
        other person and the matter at hand!

-   Pilani Campus, Love at First sight. Never really felt like
    coming back.
    -   The arts/non-technical clubs there are simply superb! We
        have a lot to learn
    -   Cycling on campus. A dream come true!
    -   All Night Canteen is a real hangout place!
    -   Green, Greener, Greenest. Never really felt like we were in
        the deserts of Rajasthan.
    -   .... the list can go on and on. I'll stop here.

-   FOSS n me.
    -   Attended my first FOSS event! The Install Fest @
        Quark. Wasn't as awe inspiring as I would've liked it to be,
        but still a memorable one. Simply for being my first
        install-fest and for the lessons we learnt.
    -   FOSSKriti'08 is one event I'll regret missing. It was
        absolutely amazing. I'm just hoping, people here too get to
        that level soon enough.
    -   Free Software and Freeware ain't the same stuff. It's
        extremely painful when people address FOSS stuff as
        freeware. Free Software is Software that's Free as in Free
        Speech n Freeware is software that if free as in free beer.
    -   Eagerly awaiting mukt.in v2. Can't wait to get back home!
    -   Enjoying my time on \\#mukt.in and \\#linux-india. The new DC
        hub (GNOME) for FOSS junta is cool too!
    -   There's an urgent need to start contributing to FOSS. But
        how?

-   Haven't yet found myself an intern/project for summer. Wonder
    what's in store, this summer.
-   Most of the gang's On-Campus next sem. Will really miss Voodoo
    though. Hoping he has a rocking PS.
-   Hoping we won't have to shift hostels next sem.
-   Appreciation is a great motivator. Expressing it promptly is
    important. I'm bad at it. Should work on it.
-   "The gang" is like a flock of birds in flight.
-   This semester is coming to an end already, and I don't have
    anything I'd be proud of.
-   Wonder why I have absolutely no feelings about the farewell we'd
    be having soon.
-   Awaiting Ugadi Celebs. Seems like they are gonna rock more than
    ever.
-   Gone are those days, when I used to post because something I had
    to write about, compelled me to do so. These days, the long
    inactivity on my blog is turning out to be the sole reason for
    my posts. [A few Rare Exceptions though, and this one isn't] I
    wonder if its because life's become uneventful or because I grew
    lazier or because of something else.
-   I don't like posting accounts of events from the recent/distant
    past, but I'm doing it just to prevent my blog's death.
