A couple of weeks ago, I was at [PyCon India](https://in.pycon.org/2018/) -- the 10th edition, the 8th PyCon I
was attending. It was great to see so many enthusiastic young developers,
attending their first PyCon. With each year, as the event gets bigger, you see
more and more of them. Lot of curiosity, and enthusiasm to become better
programmers.

The conference had a whole bunch of talks, catering to people with varied
interests, at different stages in their career -- war stories, tips and tricks,
helpful advice on getting started with a library or tool, thoughts on the
community culture, etc. With each passing year, there are more and more
proposals for talks, and a lot of good talks have to be left out due to
constraints on the number of talks that the conference can accommodate.

Having said that, I'd have liked to see a talk on self-care tips for developers
-- advice on staying sane and productive in the long run. It is quite common for
programmers to get burnt-out. I'm sure there are some useful lessons to be
shared by everyone who has been programming professionally for a while --
ranging from about a couple of years to many decades!

In a hallway conversation, [Noufal](https://twitter.com/noufalibrahim/) was telling some of us about the [Okinawa
martial art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawan%5Fmartial%5Farts) lessons he's been taking - it was inspiring to see how seriously he
takes the lessons. A lot of programmers that I know, who have been programming
for a while, have other interests that they pursue quite seriously, to take time
off from programming. It would be nice to have someone speak about mental health
and self care in a talk, rather than hope that people pick it up in hallway
conversations. Explicit is better than implicit.

I was considering doing a lightning talk on this, but I didn't get in touch with
the organizers early enough to get a slot. So, here's a blog post.

**Disclaimer**: Not all of these are things I'm good at doing consistently, but
they are things that have at some point helped me. This post is also a way for
me to write down things that I (or others) can come back to whenever necessary.


## Take breaks {#take-breaks}

We are often so engrossed in getting something to work, that we lose track of
time -- slumping in our chairs for hours on end, forgetting to eat, hydrate or
move around.

Our bodies weren't made for this -- we were built to move around. Also, stepping
away from the problem for a bit, after wrestling with it for a while, brings a
fresh perspective and new ideas.

You could use a tool like [workrave](http://www.workrave.org/) to remind you to take regular breaks and
stretch. Or use a [Pomodoro timer](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique). Another trick is to drink keep drinking water
regularly, so you are forced to get up and take a piss, every once in a while.


## Hydrate, Eat and Sleep {#hydrate-eat-and-sleep}

Being dehydrated can make one feel tired and sleepy, making it hard to focus
well. Same goes for being hungry and sleep-deprived. Not having enough glucose
in your blood has been [shown](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889) to cause people to make bad decisions.

Mental work uses up a lot of energy, even if we seem to be just sitting around
all day, and not expending much more energy than sleeping. It is important to
feel good physically to work effectively.

You could have a bottle of water next to you, that you frequently drink from and
keep re-filling at breaks. Don't skip on your lunch to use that extra half an
hour being productive. Keeping some snack accessible for you to eat towards the
end of the day, when you are tired, helps. Use a sleep tracker or just roughly
track sleep each night manually. Make sure you are getting enough of it.


## Invest in a good set-up {#invest-in-a-good-set-up}

We spend around half of our waking time at work - over a life time, that's a lot
of time! Sitting in a bad posture, or doing a only-slightly-uncomfortable action
over and over, can easily grow into bigger problems in the long run.

You deserve good quality equipment, that "fits" you well. Get yourself a good
keyboard and mouse, an external monitor, or whatever it is that you think will
make your body thank you. If you end-up working a lot from your home office,
invest in a good chair and a table.


## Sunlight & Exercise {#sunlight-and-exercise}

Being locked up in our office buildings all day doesn't help with how much
exposure we get to the sun. Not getting enough sunlight regularly can effect us
both mentally and physically. Same goes for exercise. Getting some exercise
everyday has been shown to have significant mental and physical health benefits.

You can start playing a sport, if hitting the gym or doing something alone seems
like a chore. Playing a team sport helps even more since there are other people
you are accountable to. Try to get some sunlight every morning, even if it is
just standing out in the sun, while you drink your coffee.


## Take Vacations {#take-vacations}

Switch off completely, and give your body and mind the rest they deserve. The
break not only lets you rejuvenate physically, but also gives your brain the
time to synthesize all the inputs it has, and come back with surprising ideas or
solutions to problems that have been troubling you for a while.

The importance of taking a break is often forgotten, when we have so much to do.
Honestly, I'm not very good at taking regular vacations, myself.

But, having a fixed time every year to take a vacation is something that I've
seen working. For example, 2 weeks around your birthday every year, you can
decide to take a vacation.


## Do other things {#do-other-things}

We get into the game because we are really excited by the things we can build by
flipping bits. We get so obsessed with it, that we lose ourselves in it,
oblivious to the world outside. All the people we hangout with are people very
similar to us.

Often, we are building stuff for people very unlike us. It's very helpful to see
the world from a different perspective than ours. Also, there is only so much we
can express through code. There is a whole lot of us that can be expressed in
other ways.

Pick up a [team sport](https://thatteidlikaalsoup.team/), do improv/stand-up, draw or paint, write, learn a martial
art, join a cross fit gym -- anything that you find interesting, other than
writing code. Hangout with people who do very different things everyday than
what you do. Their completely different perspective at life will make you a
better programmer and a better person.


## Avoid distractions {#avoid-distractions}

The internet can be [so distracting](https://xkcd.com/477/)! But, as developers, we tend to be constantly
connected, leaving ourselves vulnerable to all this distraction. All these
distractions can lead to very [expensive context switches](https://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/).

I've found getting into, and working in flow-states to be enormously satisfying.
What I'm actually working on, doesn't matter very much when I'm to deeply focus
on something I want to be doing.

Creating an environment for yourself, where its easy to get into these states,
is totally worth it. I've found using [Pomodoros](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) to be quite helpful, when I'm
feeling distracted. Shutting off the Internet, or using a tool like
[get-shit-done](https://github.com/viccherubini/get-shit-done) helps with stopping myself from getting distracted by cat videos
on the internet. Turning off all notifications on my phone and computer is
another thing that is quite effective I also find it helpful to not be able to
constantly have sight of the clock on my computer - so I work with all my
windows full-screen. [Leaving the phone in another room](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/691462) or in my bag works great,
too. You can find a lot more tips on the internet, if these tricks aren't up
your alley.

If you see your team over-working themselves, and holding exhaustion as a badge
of honour, please be the person to strike conversations around self care. Your
team will thank you.

I've only listed down some of the things that I've found helpful. But, I hope
this serves as a good starting point. Also, do take a look at [selfcare.tech](http://selfcare.tech/) for
more resources and advice.

Thanks Akilesh Mani and [Shantanu Choudhary](<http://baali.muse-amuse.in/>) for
reading drafts of this and giving helpful suggestions.
