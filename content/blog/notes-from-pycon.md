Just back after attending PyCon India '10. It was not as exciting
as I hoped it would be.  That's generally the case with any
conference I attend.  (I guess, I expect too much from them. :P)

The keynote by David Goodger (pronounced like Badger :) was
"Good".  It was a very simple one talking of how to get Python
into the workplace.  His simple recommendation was to use Python
if we saw any opportunity where it could be used, without
bothering about permissions, convincing people etc.  "It's better
to ask for forgiveness, than for permission."  He spoke of myths
around Python -- scripting language, dynamic language, too much
white space, toy language, nobody uses it.  He concluded the talk,
by saying mentioning Indian driving to be an indication of some
quick reflexes that we Indians have. ;) On the whole it was an
enlightening, humorous and enjoyable talk.

I didn't attend too many of other talks.  Amongst the ones that I
did attend, I particularly liked the one by Asim Mittal on using
the Nintendo Wii with Python.

On some thought about my experiences at conferences, I think
conferences shouldn't have any talks at all.  Or atleast, I
shouldn't be attending conferences for talks.  They are an excuse
to catch-up with people.  Conferences should have only lightning
talks of 10 mins and sprints.  Talks, with an extensive
explanation of stuff that can be easily found on the web, are a
waste of time.
