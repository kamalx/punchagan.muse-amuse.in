Exam time now. Sleep time cut-down! [already compensated for,
during the whole semester! :D] Getting up quite early during these
days.... [To cram in something at the last minute.. :P]

But all that kept aside, I feel great to be waking up early in the
morning. Watching the Sun rise.. is a great feeling. The calm of
the dawn, the chirping of the birds n the cool breeze.. Its
absolutely amazing -- awe inspiring. Its a great experience. A
rare one for me,though.. :( For the last four semesters, I have
been a part of the owl-tribe... staying awake till late in the
night and doing all sorts of stuff... [other than study - during
the non-exam time...] Its great fun staying awake very late in the
night... having fun with friends... B'day parties, Musical
sessions in Ringo's room, Movies, Carrom-Nights, all-night
Chats(online n offline..) and lots of other stuff.

But all this can be done during the day can't it[The fun of doing
it in the night is totally different though..]?? If I enjoy the
morning times so much, shouldn't I be enjoying it more often? If
its such a great feeling.. to be waking up in the morning.. should
I trade it with all the fun I have, late in the night?? Is it
worth it? Like Voodoo believes, should I put in efforts to enjoy
the sunrise each day??  Is it time.. that I try out the
cliche... "Early to Bed, Early to Rise..." [EBER -- that's what UC
calls it... and hence the title... :P]

**Update:** If for Fear, people are able to
cut-down so much on their sleep, and work so hard, I wonder how
much is possible for **LOVE**. I think this is the thing that drives
all the great achievers... the Scientists.. the Hackers.. the
Artists.. the Engineers... the Writers.. the Doctors.. and a lot
of others...  I need to find something, that I would Love to work
on.
