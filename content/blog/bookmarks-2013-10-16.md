-   [Do you want a meaningful or a happy life? – Roy F Baumeister – Aeon](http://www.aeonmagazine.com/world-views/do-you-want-a-meaningful-life-or-a-happy-one/)

    :life:happiness:meaning:

    People ask what is the meaning of life, as if there is a single
    answer. There is no one answer: there are thousands of different
    ones. A life will be meaningful if it finds responses to the four
    questions of purpose, value, efficacy, and self-worth. It is these
    questions, not the answers, that endure and unify.

-   [QUIZ: Modern Art or Children’s Drawings? | Bored Panda](http://www.boredpanda.com/modern-art-vs-toddler-art/)

    :art:

    Art, and what we do and do not consider to be art, has changed a lot
    over the last century. It has become an increasingly difficult thing
    to define for the average person, and sometimes even art historians
    and experts can’t seem to keep up.

    This was illustrated in a 2005 survey done by ABC News in which
    modern masters’ works were mixed into a series with paintings done
    by children and toddlers. Regular people and art critics alike were
    asked to choose from the series – which of these works belong in a
    museum and which ones don’t? Now, Buzzfeed has released a similar
    survey as well, which we’ve expanded on a bit.

    The results of that survey indicate that either we have a long way
    to go before we can define what is and isn’t modern art, or that
    there’s no need to define it so strictly in the first
    place. Whatever the case may be, let’s see if you’re any better at
    telling modern art from children’s drawings than the experts are!
