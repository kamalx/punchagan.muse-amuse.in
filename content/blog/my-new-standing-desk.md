There is so much popular-science out there that describes sitting as the new
smoking. But, there's also some research that talk about standing all day not
being good for the heart, etc. [This article](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/debate-over-standing-vs-sitting-at-your-desk) refers to a lot of research that
present both sides of the coin.

I'm currently leaning towards switching positions regularly, rather than staying
in a single posture for hours together. Standing or sitting -- keep moving, keep
taking breaks. But, standing makes it slightly easier to get more movement -
just removing the need to get up from that chair, seems to help.

Some years ago, I built myself another make-shift standing desk, but didn't end
up using it - because it turned out to be not sufficiently big and comfortable
to work on.

I have been looking around on the Internet to buy myself a standing desk. But,
they are either [super expensive](https://www.amazon.in/SONGMICS-Standing-Adjustable-Workstation-Converter/dp/B075WRJDMZ), or [not](https://oristand.co/) [adjustable](https://www.amazon.in/Spark-Ergodriven-Perfect-Standing-Medium/dp/B01GGNV6VQ) enough to ensure the right
ergonomics. Given there's so much being written against sitting, I'd have
expected there to be enough demand for these desks to bring down their prices!

Last week, I built another desk, which feels much more sturdy than the previous
one. It's also much more easy to move around (within the house), and a breeze to
assemble and disassemble. Again, I re-purposed some "furniture" lying around.

I've been using it only for a few days now. I'll probably make another post with
my experiences of using it. I plan to set it on the floor and use it as a squat
desk, when I'm tired of standing. Let's see how it goes!
