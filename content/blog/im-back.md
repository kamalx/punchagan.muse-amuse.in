After a short break, I'm back to blogging!
A few things have changed meanwhile. A lot haven't.

-   Noetic Nought shall now be called Rustic Reverie.

-   The Blogs I read page is now manually populated. More pages might be
    coming soon.

-   My web presence has almost been reduced to just this blog. I hope to
    be blogging more often this time around. I guess I'll have shorter
    and more frequent posts. "Release early, Release often."

-   I've been inspired by Sacha Chua and her wonderful blog. She puts up
    anything that -

    -   she may look up in future.
    -   could be remotely useful to anybody on this planet.

    I like her idea of "thinking of writing as sketching". "Keep
    repeating yourself, until the core message floats to the top". It
    feels similar to the idea - "Release early, Release often."

-   Also, Thanks to Madhu and Vattam who set an impossibly high standard
    by having their resumes and letters of recommendations and other
    "personal" stuff on version control on public repositories.

-   All my posts will be made from org2blog - a little org-mode based
    client that I hacked up. Emacs and Org-mode all the way! This is the
    first post by me (and probably anybody) from org2blog!
