PS stands for Practice School...

I would've titled this post, "NPL... here I come!!" but for all
this...

It all began with an unannounced letter from the PS
division... giving us just 5 days time to fill up our "PS-1"
forms... with Waves round the corner.. this was too short a
notice.. and the panic button was pressed.. and pressed real
hard!! {lots of heated discussion.. frantic google
searches.. repeated calls to/from home.. etc were kicked off...}

Then, the filling up of on-line forms... [oh you thought.. online
forms were a cakewalk?? even i thought so.. until this!!] We had
to fill a priority list of 214 items.. flat... That was not the
big problem... We had a not so well developed form handler...[i'm
probably being unfair to the developers...because the server also
caused quite a few problems... but that's the least i can say...]
I know of people.. who learnt their options by-heart... thanks to
the wonderful system and the server, that made them fill the whole
list 4 to 5 times..

Then there was this headache of filling up everything in
ink... [one of the rare ocassions.. other than reports for MT n
Mu-P... when i wrote so much.. and felt it all useless...]

Then, a meeting organised by seniors to "help" us choose
PS[Practice School] stations... noble intentions.. but i ended up
being more confused!! [After telling all the good stuff.. they
came down to the point that staying close to home.. is the best
thing to do.. this put me in soup!]

All this is nothing when compared to the "declaration of results"
(it wasn't any exam.. to call the allotment.. results.. but the
use of these words is intentional...)  First, there was an April
fool attempt by one of the students... it was quite cleverly
planned but the little error of sending everyone the same
password.. ended the whole thing tamely.. but it dindn't go for
nothing.. it was successful in rebuilding the stage... people
began discussing the topic..

After a wait of 4 days... the D-day finally arrived... and people
went crazy!! As if the excitement wasn't enough.. the PSD added
its bit.. the results weren't sent to everyone at once.. they sent
it one by one, discipline-wise... (god only knows how they managed
the feat[around 1400 students!!], manually) People were eagerly
waiting for the results... a world cup final would have been no
match... F5 keys on all the keyboards took a beating... People
shouting wildly!! (both in delight and rage..).. There was quite a
lot of Drama...

Now after the reality has sunk in... its a bit cooler... but still
quite humid.. every talk inevitably is leading just to this... a
lot of analysis, discussions and post-mortem going on.... happy
about their partners/collegues... people getting angry with
others(both for discussing and not discussing about
it..)... unhappy with partners... phew! a lot of action all around
the place... [It's as if a sleeping Giant has just been woken
up...]

After all this hype and ballyhoo.. i just hope the PS stands up to
something... I mean.. I hope I stand up to it.... and do
something.. some small bit of work.. that'll keep me hooked for a
couple of months.. something that'll be worth thinking of later on
in life... something that'll be worth posting abt...:-P
ok!.... "NPL... Here I come...!!"
