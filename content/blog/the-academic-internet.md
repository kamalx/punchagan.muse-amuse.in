This Notice from the Computer Center is creating waves all
around. This isn't the first time, though, that the people
in-charge of the Network have "acted".

Academic activities; wonder what it's definition is, in their
dictionaries. It surely includes the following.

-   Using Internet for 'academic activities' or emails, during
    class-room hours makes no sense.
-   Anything 'academic' cannot have a size greater than 5 MB.
-   Accessing version control systems ( svn, cvs et al ) cannot be
    classified 'academic'
-   IRC cannot teach you anything. Don't ever dream of thinking it
    as 'academic' to hang out on \\#python or \\#emacs
-   All 'academic' stuff is limited to the http(s) ports. You
    wouldn't need to use any other ports, ever.
-   Any 'academic' activity fits within a span of 2 hours or can be
    done in blocks of 2 hours each, with gaps of 2 hours in between.
-   'Academic' stuff doesn't definitely contain key-words chosen by
    the "all-knowing" admins.

Moreover, the people in-charge who refused to allow the use of a
computer in the CC as a server for on-campus repositories of
GNU/Linux packages, now wish to host a 'hub' for sharing
open-source softwares! There's already an official ftp server
which hosts the academic info and a few useful softwares. I don't
see how a hub would be different.

We don't have any disciplinary committees for people smoking in
hostel rooms, causing a lot of trouble for others around them, but
we are going to have them for hosting hubs. ( Well, a new law
banning smoking in public places in India has been passed just a
few days ago. Hopefully it'll work better than the older one,
since now there's some pressure on the people in-charge of the
public place. )

Also, it could be argued that college isn't meant only for
'academic' learning and a lots of other learning takes place here
(and the hubs were definitely helping quite a bit) but I'll leave
that for another day, probably. Also, I don't think 18+ year olds,
people who are about to step into various big roles, leading the
country need to be told how to make use of the
facilities/resources available to them; A degree of freedom is
indispensable, I believe.

I appreciate the efforts being made to improve the network
situation here and also help the students get the most (
'academically' ) out of their college experience, but I feel the
situation deserves more careful handling.
