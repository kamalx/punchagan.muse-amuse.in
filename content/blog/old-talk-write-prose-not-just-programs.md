I've recently signed up for the [Art of Clear Writing](https://indiauncut.com/clear-writing/) course by Amit Verma. It
is still early days and I can't comment on the course itself.  But, the
discussion after the first class reminded me of a talk I had given a couple of
years ago -- Write Prose, Not Just Programs.

A friend, [Vivek](https://twitter.com/vivekv), had nudged me to do a talk on "Writing for Developers" and I
ended up talking to his team about a week later. The PyCon India CFP was open a
couple of months later, where I submitted this talk and it was accepted.

Even if a couple of years late, I thought it might be helpful to leave links to
the talk video and slides on my blog. So, here they are:

-   [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TucAxOO68c)

PS: Ironically, my blog hasn't seen much activity after giving that talk due to
various reasons.  I've been meaning and trying to change that off-late, though.
