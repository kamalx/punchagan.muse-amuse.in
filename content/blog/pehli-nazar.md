This post is my attempt to start a travelogue. I hope to capture
the "All India Tour" phase of my life (as people have started to
call it).  I'll try to keep these posts from becoming travel
guides. There are loads of them and I surely don't need to
increment count.

This post is after a trip to Kanpur, Agra and Sikri.

-   Trains are never on Time. The delay increases exponentially with
    your distance from the sourthern most tip of the country. Also,
    the confidence of the aam admi in this delay is proportional to
    the distance. Any delay less than an hour wasn't considered to
    be a delay. Thanks to the fog, low visibility.
-   If you want to travel around India, all you need is an
    SLR. Additionally, if you are not of Indian origin, you'll need
    the "India" guide. I got bored of seeing people poring over the
    pages of that "blue" India book or madly clicking away on their
    SLRs.
-   Whether or not you get food or water on a train, you are assured
    of enough "chilled" air from the slit under your window. Come
    what may, you shall not be deprived of this service.
-   The trust of a person in you is inversely proportional to the
    difference between your ages. It is inversely proportional to
    the 2.718th power of the difference if you are aged between 20
    and 25. I only vaguely remember what the TTE told me in my
    sleep, while paying the fine for not carrying a print out of our
    e-ticket; but, it really was something sick and senseless.
-   The chill at a place, on the day you reach, is inversely
    proportional to how much people have scared/warned you. On the
    rest of the days, it is proportional to the square of the warm
    clothing you have on you. I thoroughly enjoyed the chill of
    Kanpur. Wonderful! The infrastructure, too good! Never expected
    a 50 year old campus to be so Awesome. [They have an air-strip
    too!]
-   The thrill of having an ice-cream is proportional to the square
    of difference between the ambient temperature and the standard
    room temperature.
-   Don't ever think of celebrating your escape, without the Aalu
    encounter. Welcome to the land of Alu addicted men. You shall,
    surely, have your share. If not anything else, you shall be
    serverd a Capsicum or Brinjal stuffed with Aalu. Also, the
    quality and availability of leather seems to be proportional to
    the addiction to Aalu.
-   "hawker time" - the time you spend being followed by hawkers
    trying to convince you to buy whatever they
    have. "firang-ness" - difficult to predict; a parameter that
    depends on the amount of branded stuff on you, stylishness of
    your winter wear and other unknown variableness. Your hawker
    time is proportional to (firang-ness) \\\* abs(time of day in 24
    hr clock - 1400) [when, 900 < time < 1800] I understand, that,
    they need to make ends meet; each day of their lives. I got
    followed a lot. I can't help observing. Sometimes, enjoyed being
    followed too.

The Taj. Simply Awe-Inspiring. As Madhu put it, "the longer you
keep watching it, the more it's beauty overwhelms you". But, I
still think, the first time is the best time to see it. It's
simply mind blowing when you get the first glimpse, after entering
from the West gate.

It's time to stop writing when all you can see is proportionality
between totally unrelated things.  Here are a few pics
