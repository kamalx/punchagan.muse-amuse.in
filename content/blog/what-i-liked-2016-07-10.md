Airtel's [response](https://twitter.com/airtelnews/status/753518084732878848) to [@karthikb351](https://twitter.com/karthikb351)'s write up on how they are [sniffing and
censoring CloudFlare's traffic in India](https://medium.com/@karthikb351/airtel-is-sniffing-and-censoring-cloudflares-traffic-in-india-and-they-don-t-even-know-it-90935f7f6d98#---0-257.ftneqcpnh) was funny but sad, though, not totally
unexpected. For instance, see [@kingslyj](https://twitter.com/kingslyj/status/753534036996460544/photo/1)'s version of how this might end.

I loved [this interview](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/10/amanda-palmer-interview-you-got-me-singing) with Amanda Palmer where she talks about her stolen
Ukulele, Music, her dad and her baby and her love for life comes across, like
in everything else she does.  'I want to get a couple of T-shirts printed for
me and the baby that say: "We are determined to enjoy ourselves"', she says.

A year old but inspiring article on [Serena Williams](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/magazine/the-meaning-of-serena-williams.html), shared by [@baali](https://twitter.com/baali_).  I like
how she says, she's opening the next door for the next person, like the many
people who opened many doors for her. [@baali](https://twitter.com/baali_) also recommended [this song](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AxvUWofBdo4) from
Neerja as background music, and I loved it!

Pierre buttin's [screenshot art](http://www.pierrebuttin.com/work/dayonadevice/) is amusing and gives a sense of how distracted
he is, each day of the week, and how distracted we are, as a people.

We were walking through the fields and bushes in Hampi and stopped at the gate
of a private property.  A bearded man with a calm look on his face asked us "Do
you know where you are headed?".  And then let us walk across his beautiful
nature home to the other side, where we found this [amusing sign](https://slack-files.com/T0MUM6C66-F1SSJ0KC3-b85733e158).

Finally, this [Nike India ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm2EnrUAn8c) on Women in Sport is great!
