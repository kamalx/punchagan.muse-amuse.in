Note: This post isn't of much use to others (may be the same with
other posts too.. :P) Just a few ramblings of the 2 month stay @
Delhi.... (allegedly doing a Project!)

-   All Scientists ain't _Scientists_
-   There's nothing **BIG** about Research papers... [You can do
    all sorts of things in there... something like the TOI
    comparison of Sachin and the Sensex... ;)]
-   The "Hacker Culture" ought to be adopted (or atleast something
    closer to it..) at **Research** organisations.. [I thoroughly
    hated the hypocritical behaviour of the people at my PS.. ]
-   Of all the people, the guy I found closest to being a
    **hacker** [w.r.t technical skills] was the guy operating the
    Photocopier... [this could well be a case of poor observation or
    under-estimation, but that's what I feel right now.. ]
-   Perfectionists manage to be _imperfect at the perfect_
    time...
-   Need to develop the ability to **talk** crap!(not just type
    in.. ) [comes in quite handy.. ]
-   I loved EBERing all these days.. got to keep it
    going. [jaanees.. need some help in this.. ;) ]
-   Loooong walks are great fun... [anybody game??]
-   I ain't a very Creative being...
-   I ought to learn to be more tolearant to using Windows, I
    guess.. [It was a real pain using it...]
-   My Will power (for doing stuff that I hate.. ) has tremendously
    increased!! Thanks to the one and only....
-   Any project that's not **my** choice will inevitably turn out to
    be a _Projest_ [can't say much abt the others.. ;)]
-   Hostel in Coll is ulti cool.. don't ever dare compare any other
    one with it..
-   and found this cool pic... [I guess I need to follow him.. ;)]
