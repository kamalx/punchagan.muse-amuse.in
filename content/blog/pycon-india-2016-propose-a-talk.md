CFP for PyCon 2016 is [open](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2016/proposals/) and you should propose a talk!

There has been a lot of discussion on trying to improve the talk quality at the
events. As my bit of contribution to this, below is a re-hash of some good
advice from the internet on why you should give a talk, and how to submit a
good proposal.


## Why? {#why}

-   You [needn't be an expert](https://vimeo.com/96692937#t=2m56s) on a topic. If you have enough experience about
    something to help make the next person's experience with it better, you are
    good.

-   Its a great way to find people who are interested in the same things as you
    are and to get to talk to them.  If you are an introvert, you should
    [definitely be speaking](https://emptysqua.re/blog/tech-talks-are-campfires-jesses-three-reasons-you-should-speak-at-pycon/#meet-specialists)!

-   Proposing and giving a talk is about thinking about something hard enough to
    refine your thoughts, and being able to explain it to others. Its a useful
    skill to hone.


## How? {#how}

-   Talks are [entertainment](http://speaking.io/plan/talks-are-entertainment/). Pick a topic that you are excited about and fascinated
    by. Let it be a general topic that will have a significant number of people
    interested in it.

-   What you want the attendees to be telling their friends about your talk,
    after they go back.  Make it the [objective](http://blog.briancurtin.com/posts/writing-a-pycon-proposal.html) of your talk.

-   Submit a complete, clear and compelling proposal. Show the reviewers that you
    are willing to put in the effort to prepare for and to give a great
    talk. Here are a [bunch of proposals](https://github.com/akaptur/pycon-proposals/tree/master/accepted) to see and learn from.

-   Submit an outline along with your talk. Show the talk can be delivered in the
    given time and will be interesting. Include an indication of how much [time](https://github.com/akaptur/pycon-proposals/blob/master/accepted/important_decisions_kaptur_2014.md#outline)
    you intend to spend on each part of your talk.

-   Choose a good title.  The title is what catches the attention of your
    audience when they are trying to pick a talk.  Avoid buzz words.

-   Get feedback. Like any writing, feedback can be helpful at all stages --
    brainstorm while choosing topics to getting critique on the full abstract.

-   Convince the reviewers that you can give a [well-rehearsed and entertaining](https://emptysqua.re/blog/seven-tips-for-pycon/#note-to-the-organizers) --
    link to previous talks you've given, include links to any testimonials you've
    received from your audience, etc.  If you don't have a previously recorded
    talk, give a small talk to your friends or colleagues and have it recorded.

-   PyCon US has some [good advice](https://us.pycon.org/2016/speaking/talks/) on how to submit a proposal and most of it is
    generic enough for you to use for PyCon India, or any other conference.

-   These posts ([1](https://emptysqua.re/blog/tech-talks-are-campfires-jesses-three-reasons-you-should-speak-at-pycon/) [2](https://emptysqua.re/blog/seven-tips-for-pycon/) and [more](https://emptysqua.re/blog/tag/conference-tips/)) by Jesse Davis are so so good!
