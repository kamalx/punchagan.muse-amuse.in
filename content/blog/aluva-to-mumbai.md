Heavy down-pour and landslides caused our train to be delayed by
over 12 hours. But the journey was on the whole enjoyable.

The novelty of the journey was that we had a bus ride from Adavali
to Ratnagiri, arranged by the Indian Railways, owing to bad tracks
near Ratnagiri.  It was very well planned and neatly executed.
Kudos Indian Railways!  The Konkan Rail route was at it's usual
best.
