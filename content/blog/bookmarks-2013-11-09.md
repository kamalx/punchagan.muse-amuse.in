-   [9 Mind Expanding Books Of Philosophy That Are Actually Readable (A Guide To Practical Philosophy) | Thought Catalog](http://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/11/practical-philosophy/)

    The irony is this is actually what ancient philosophy was intended
    to ameliorate. “Vain is the word of a philosopher,” Epicurus once
    said, “which does not heal the suffering of man.” Centuries later,
    Thoreau expressed this same thought: “To be a philosopher is not
    merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school . . . it
    is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically,
    but practically.”

    A lot of people mistake flashy ultimate for “good” ultimate—they
    think that chest-high layouts or 10-foot grabs in wolf packs are
    hallmarks of the elite game. But I beg to differ. It’s true,
    sometimes incredible feats of athleticism are the only way to save a
    possession or get a block—and they aren’t easy to execute. Still,
    it’s the most mundane things that often make the biggest impacts on
    the field.
