Imagine a kid reading Shakespeare's Othello or As You Like
it...[or may be some other classic poem...] with great difficulty
he somehow manages to read the whole thing... [with all the
archaic language etc..] he understands the basic plot and the
story and likes it... but will he be able to appreciate the work?
Will he be able to see the beauty of it?? Isn't a good knowledge
of Language a bare essential for one to enjoy a Literary work??

Now consider a layman... listening to Classical [say Carnatic]
Music... if he's got no knowledge of the Basic structure and
organisation of Music in general or a Raga in particular.. then he
may enjoy the musical work... listen to it happily.... but will he
get the taste of its nectar from the fine intricacies in it??
Isn't a basic sense of Music... a knowledge of the language of
Music necessary to understand the fine points of a Musical piece??

Isn't the case similar with Science [Feynman says nature..]??
Without a proper knowledge base in Mathematics.. how would I
possibly understand and appreciate Physics/Science (in general..)
and Relativity in particular?? [I got this feeling, after class
today, for the zillionth time...] How can I possibly enjoy a
course in Relativity without a proper Math background???

I need to learn a lot of Mathematics.. its high time I do it... :(

To those who do not know mathematics it is difficult to get across
a real feeling as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature
... If you want to learn about nature, to appreciate nature, it is
necessary to understand the language that she speaks in.
--Richard P. Feynman
