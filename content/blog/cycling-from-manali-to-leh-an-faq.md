## So, you cycled from Manali to Leh? {#so-you-cycled-from-manali-to-leh}

Well, Not really. We cycled from [Kalath to Whiskey Nala](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/26328981) -- a distance of 280km
-- which is about 60% of the Manali-Leh route.


## Who is "we"? {#who-is-we}

[Vivek](https://www.strava.com/athletes/24792932) and I were on the bikes. [Shabu](https://www.facebook.com/people/Hemant-Sharma/100002458775314) was our guide helping us fix our bikes and
fixing up our meals, but more than anything else, ensuring that we don't freeze
to death. Susheel was driving along and cheering us.


## What is the maximum elevation you cycled to? {#what-is-the-maximum-elevation-you-cycled-to}

We started off at around 1.8km and went up to about 5km in a span of 5 days. We
also spent a day in Manali, getting our cycles fixed and acclimatizing. You can
see the elevation profile [here](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/26328981).


## How long did the whole ride take? {#how-long-did-the-whole-ride-take}

Our plan was to finish the whole distance in 7 days. We couldn't get to our
designated camp on the 5th day, and had to use the support car to get to camp
before it got dark. We decided to end the ride once we took our bikes off the
road.


## Was it really hard? Why couldn't you finish the ride? {#was-it-really-hard-why-couldn-t-you-finish-the-ride}

We expected the primary challenges to be:

-   the altitude and lack of oxygen
-   the fatigue from riding day after day after day...

But, cold played a much bigger role than we thought it would. As we got higher
and higher, it got so cold that we spent a significant amount of energy and
brain cycles on trying to fight the cold, rather than enjoying the views or
pushing ourselves to keep going despite the non-cold-related discomfort.


## So, you do really need a support vehicle? {#so-you-do-really-need-a-support-vehicle}

Not really, if you were riding in better weather or were better prepared. The
Manali to Leh route usually has a lot of temporary shops setup during the
season, where you could crash, if it was too cold to just crash in your tent.
Since, we were going after the season had almost ended, many of these shops were
no longer open, and having the support car turned out to be quite useful on the
last day.


## Did you carry your own bikes? {#did-you-carry-your-own-bikes}

Yes.

1.  Flew from Bengaluru to Delhi
2.  Took a bus from Delhi to Manali
3.  Carried the bikes on the support car from Whiskey Nala to Leh
4.  Flew back from Leh to Delhi


## Did the flights charge you for the bikes? {#did-the-flights-charge-you-for-the-bikes}

The carrier (IndiGo) from BLR to DEL charged us a handling fees of Rs. 1000. The
carrier (Vistara) on the return journey didn't.


## Would you recommend me to carry my bike? {#would-you-recommend-me-to-carry-my-bike}

You could find bikes on rent, both in Manali and Leh, for about 500 to 700 per
day. It would cost about 5-7k, based on how you plan your ride, to rent a bike.
You'll have to make arrangements to get the bike returned back to the place you
rent it from -- this can get a little tricky.

If you already own a bike, and can it packed in a proper box, I would highly
recommend that. We hadn't paid enough attention to packing our bikes, and one of
our bikes took quite some beating on the way to Delhi. On the way back, we
managed to get the bike packed in a box and it was a breeze.


## What cycle spares/tools did you carry? {#what-cycle-spares-tools-did-you-carry}

We were sort of ill prepared in this department. We only had the following:

-   Hand pump
-   Puncture kit
-   Spare tubes (2 nos.)
-   Allen key set

Based on advice from Shabu, I think you should also take these things:

-   Brake cables
-   Gear cables
-   Spare tyre (1 Nos.)
-   Brake shoes/pads
-   Few spokes
-   Chain oil


## What sort of preparation did you do for this ride? {#what-sort-of-preparation-did-you-do-for-this-ride}

We did a handful of 50-100km rides on weekends before this one. The only real
elevation training/trial that we did was the [Kalhatti climb](https://www.strava.com/activities/1211612521), one weekend before
this ride. This turned out to be pretty useful, and we found all the other
climbs during this ride much less steeper then some of the Kalhatti ones.

## What was the most enjoyable part of the ride? {#what-was-the-most-enjoyable-part-of-the-ride}

-   I really enjoyed sitting at Deepak Tal, and just looking at the clear water
-   The climb to Baralacha La was the most challenging part of the ride. We could
    see that the weather was really bad in all the peaks around us, and it was
    getting really cold. Briefly, it was even snowing very lightly and we could
    see tiny snow flakes floating in front of us.
-   The feeling of reaching the top of passes was quite thrilling, for both
    Rohtang and Baralacha La. Nakee La, not so much, since we still had about 30km
    ahead of us to finish the day.
-   It was humbing to see all the BRO folks working to keep the roads open and
    functional! A big salute to them!
-   The tree covered road in Sissu was just mind blowingly beautiful, with all the
    trees golden and yellow, preparing for the fall.
-   It was also nice to turn 30, in the hills. Vivek tried to make it as special
    for me as he could.


## What was the most challenging part of the ride? {#what-was-the-most-challenging-part-of-the-ride}

The cold. (See, the [answer](#orga26dad7) on why we didn't finish the ride).


## Would you do this again? {#would-you-do-this-again}

May be. We feel like we got a taste of the challenge of the ride, and the rest
of the route wouldn't be anymore challenging than what we already saw, if we did
it in better weather. But, the better weather would also mean more traffic and
noise on the road.


## If not, what other routes would you try? {#if-not-what-other-routes-would-you-try}

-   Cycling around Europe sounds like a fun thing to try
-   Rides in the western ghats and/or Kerala seem promising
-   A Tour of Meghalaya was something a friend suggested
-   Pushing that a little more would be riding all the way to Singapore/Indonesia,
    starting at home.
