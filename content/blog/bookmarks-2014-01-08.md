-   [Keep Him Close | Oculus](http://daddysan.wordpress.com/2013/12/26/keep-him-close/)

    For what it’s worth, my son’s going to have to put up with random
    kisses, hair ruffles and hugs, whether he likes it or not. I’m gong
    to sneak into his room and cuddle up with him in that tiny bed
    because the world will swallow me in the morning and I’ll miss
    seeing him.

-   [Totally like whatever, you know? | Taylor Mali](http://www.taylormali.com/poems-online/totally-like-whatever-you-know/)

    I entreat you, I implore you, I exhort you,
    I challenge you: To speak with conviction.

-   [How to Get Startup Ideas](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)

    The best approach is more indirect: if you have the right sort of
    background, good startup ideas will seem obvious to you. But even
    then, not immediately. It takes time to come across situations where
    you notice something missing. And often these gaps won't seem to be
    ideas for companies, just things that would be interesting to
    build. Which is why it's good to have the time and the inclination
    to build things just because they're interesting.

    Live in the future and build what seems interesting. Strange as it
    sounds, that's the real recipe.

-   [Flow charts in code: enter graphviz and the “dot” language](http://melp.nl/2013/08/flow-charts-in-code-enter-graphviz-and-the-dot-language/)

    I like typing code. It says what it is. I even considered writing
    graphs such as flow charts or database models in SVG once, but
    that’s a bridge too far. What is pretty helpful though, is graphviz,
    and the “dot” language.

-   [DEMONS](http://demonsfilm.net/)

    In late 2012, Jody Ruth was stood on the edge of a cliff, looking to
    end his life. Luckily, he came back, but many others don’t. Jody
    found solace in writing, and wrote a hard-hitting blog called
    ‘Demons’ about what took him to the edge of the cliff, and what
    happened whilst he was there.
