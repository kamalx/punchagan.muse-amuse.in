I accidentally came across the blog-post Git-powered wikis
improved - GitHub. And this particular paragraph caught my
eye:

> The new editor has the capability to support every markup
> language that GitHub Wikis support. If you're a fan of Markdown,
> Textile, pod or RDoc, the function bar buttons (e.g. bold,
> italic, underline, etc.) will now work. We've even written brand
> new inline help for many of GitHub Wiki's supported markup
> languages.
>
> The language definitions the editor uses are JSON-based and easy
> to edit. If you'd like us to support a markup language that we
> don't currently support, Gollum, GitHub's wiki software, is
> entirely open source -- fork our code and send us a pull request
> with changes that support your choice language.

I sent a quick patch for org-mode in the function bar, and it has
been accepted.  :)

If not anything more, I hope, at least a couple of curious people
will explore org-mode and find it useful.
