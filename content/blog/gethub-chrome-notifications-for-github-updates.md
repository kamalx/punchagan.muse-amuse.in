Over the last two days, I hacked up my first Chrome extension.
I've been using Chrome only for the past couple of weeks or so and
I begin to like it, though some of the extensions aren't as mature
as I would've liked.

The original idea was floated by my friend,  Madhu, and Lee helped
me quite a bit, while I was working on it.


## What does it do? {#what-does-it-do}

It is a simple extension, that shows pop-ups, whenever there is
an update in your GitHub "Wall" (yes, this is a Facebook world)
or News Feed as they call it.

After installation, you will need to save your `username` and
`token` for the extension to work.


## Where to get it? {#where-to-get-it}

Presently, you will need to get it from GitHub.

I might add it to the Chrome Web Store, once I see more people
using it.  I couldn't justify, to myself, paying the initial
one-time verification fee that Google asks for.

**UPDATE**: <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2011-03-04 Fri] </span></span> Added GetHub to the store
