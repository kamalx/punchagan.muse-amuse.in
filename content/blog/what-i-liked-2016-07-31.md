Lots of Olympics stuff this week!

I really liked this ad - [Rukna Nahi Hai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8to12qpeXg) - wishing all the Olympians a
wonderfully spirited competition, at Rio.  Go!

Brazilian marathoner Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima, the man who lit the Olympic
flame, inspires me with [his spirit](http://qz.com/752356/the-inspiring-reason-olympic-marathoner-vanderlei-cordeiro-de-lima-lit-the-olympic-cauldron/).

[This story](http://scroll.in/article/812876/from-ambattur-to-rio-the-journey-of-an-athlete-from-chennais-suburbs-to-the-2016-olympics) of Mohan Kumar from Ambattur, a Chennai suburb is inspiring. "Now I
am on the relay team. But in the next Olympics, I want to qualify for the
individual event. That's my aim.", he says.

[@vandith](https://twitter.com/vandith) recommended the [Nike+ Training App](http://www.nike.com/in/en_gb/c/nike-plus/training-app) to me and I really like it.  They
have some amazing workouts and pretty neat personalized workout plans.

Coke Studio Pakistan is trying a [delightful experiment](http://thereel.scroll.in/812923/coke-studio-for-the-deaf-will-change-the-way-you-think-about-music) with their show this
time -- they are trying to use lights and vibrations to let the
hearing-impaired experience the music on their show better!

Sainath's [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQjLj-suogQ) at Film Writers Association conference was yet another of his
thought-provoking speeches.  He sends you down a spiral of thought, when he
says, "How agonised we are when people die, and how untroubled we are by how
they live".  I also enjoyed watching his (long) [casual chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYVLmHdBjPI) from an year ago,
talking about his life and influences on him.

David Sassoon the founder of InsideClimate News [writes](https://medium.com/insideclimate-news/seven-things-you-need-to-know-about-non-profit-journalism-f1409b95fdad#.4fai5oqca) about Non-Profit
journalism, the need for it, and how to have more of it.  He writes about it in
the American context, but India has its own share of troubles.  I consume quite
a bit of news from independent sources, but don't really contribute to keep
them going.  I should turn this around.

A bunch of residents of Urur Olcott Kuppam in Chennai [responded](http://scroll.in/article/813133/media-got-it-wrong-in-its-coverage-of-tm-krishnas-magsaysay-award-say-fishing-village-residents) to media's
broken coverage of TM Krishna's Magsaysay award.  I really liked how assertive
they were about their role in the music festival, its role in their lives, and
in clarifying how they see their fishing village as opposed to how the media
portrayed it.  They don't mince any words.
