    There is a time and a place for reflection and contemplation about
    the greater universe. Now, I know I sound like a hypocrite because I
    do write about these things a lot, but I’ll tell you now, as someone
    who does over-think it, sometimes you just have to let it be what it
    is and not become overwhelmed by the vastness, mysteriousness and
    unknown possibility that lies around us. It can be more debilitating
    than inspiring sometimes.

    Before Hemant could nod his head, Sachin was already in the field as
    a substitute for Pakistan. It was towards the end of the match and
    Sachin was on the field for about 25 minutes."

    Deep down, many of us wonder if we’re wasting our time on things of
    little consequence. So we keep skittering along the surface at a
    feverish pace, avoiding the mirror of introspection.

    I’ve found recently that when the time is used well, slowness can
    actually be one of the most profound sources of abundance.

    And on the positive side, sometimes entrepreneurs work on their
    businesses after hours out of love, rather than straining toward an
    overly-optimistic deadline out of fear. I’ve been there, I’ve put in
    the hours and I’ll do it again. But not unless I’m motivated by
    love.
