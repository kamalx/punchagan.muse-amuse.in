At work, we use hg and to be frank, I haven't really got the
hang of using it well. I've recently started using git for my own
work and I'm loving it.

I chose git because

-   github seems to be a nice place to hang around, as compared to
    bit-bucket.
-   org-mode uses git and I need to learn to use git, if I intend

contribute anything to org-mode.

But after using git for a month or so, I'm totally loving using
git. The way it handles merges is awesome. People go gaga over
it's speed.

But for me, it's the way it handles branches. I can have any
number of branches on my machine, while pushing only changes in
the master branch, upstream. I can easily merge changes from one
branch to another. After putting up a lot of fight, I couldn't
make hg do this. Not as well as git does it!

I've now decided to convert my personal repositories to git.

This blog post shows how to.
