Well, it's been a week of lull on my blog.  Not that I'm very
busy.  But, just didn't have anything to post.  I was feeling jobless
today and searched the web for org2blog users.  Here is what I found.

-   This is a test post from org2blog

-   Posting from emacs and org-mode

-   Vim vs Emacs, or why it really doesn’t matter

-   Posting subtree from org-mode buffer (take 2)

-   Here’s a test post to wordpress for Org2blog – an Emacs plugin

-   Primeiro post usando org2blog

-   Emacs中绘图－ ditaa篇

-   org2blog on identi.ca

-   Marcel van der Boom -- StatusNet
