A few days back I received a letter from a friend, via post! [I
know most of you can't believe this... but ya.. its true..] I
wouldn't have believed it too... if only he didn't tell that to me
when we met online... {He spoilt the fun for me! :-(} So before
going to dinner one day...(a couple of weeks back..).. I checked
out the Hostel Assistants room for any post.... and "it" was right
on top of the pile!! [Now that I speak of a pile don't imagine
that a lot of people here get personal letters... most of them
were business correspondence, magazines or likewise...]
Neways.. it was a great feeling to even look at it!! A white
envelope... and my name on it.. in his most familiar writing on
it...[no.. i don't get letters from him often.. we have been
classmates for quite some time.. so...] ... the stamp [A leapard
cat!]... and the two postmarks.. [of Pilani &amp;
Zuarinagar!! :-P]... Holding the letter in my hand.. it felt
wonderful!! [I wanted to read it right then.... but went along for
dinner...]

After dinner... and a little time in the Children's
Park... [relaxing.. wid 9,UC,Voodoo n Ringo]... I opened it! It
was absolutely thrilling... to see a couple of pages written in
ink [he still uses ink pens!! ;-)]... With full enthu.. i read the
letter.. and obviously once wasn't enough to satiate my hunger.. i
went through it over and over and over... [i wanted to scribble
down a reply ASAP... but we had waves and quark coming up.. so i
waited for them to get over (I could've written another one
right??)...to get more matter into my letter..]

Why is such a simple joy of getting a letter from a friend [there
is email.. but... for me its nowhere close to snail mail...]
become so rare these days?? [Something that was such a regular
feature of the recent past.. is almost extinct now!!] Telephone
and the Internet.... they are the culprits... (are they??.....) In
today's global village... is post a bit too slow for comfort? Will
survival of the fittest ensure the extiction of this wonderful
species in the world of communication...??

Is a letter just a matter of communication...?... Isn't there
anything more to it... [Obviously there is... otherwise I wouldn't
be writing a blog-post on it...I would never think of writing a
post on an e-mail I get!! (unless it is superhuman.. or
something..)!!] Aren't we losing out on something wonderful??

To attract good fortune, spend a new coin on an old friend, share
an old pleasure with a new friend, and lift up the heart of a true
friend by writing his name on the wings of a dragon.  -- Chinese

people it is a complete substitute for life.  -- _Andrew Brown_
