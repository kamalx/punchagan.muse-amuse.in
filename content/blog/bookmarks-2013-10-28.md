-   [Some misconceptions about Hacker School](http://composition.al/blog/2013/07/31/some-misconceptions-about-hacker-school/)

    I’ve encountered a few misconceptions about what Hacker School is
    and who it’s for. I’m not an official source of information; for
    that, I recommend the User’s Manual and this blog post. Having said
    that, here are a few things I’ve heard people say that attest to
    misconceptions about Hacker School, and my responses to them.

    The definitive listing of Static Site Generators — all 200 of them!

    My lad wouldn't like it all. He is fearless. Just like his mother.

-   [This Guy Photographed Every Stage Of His Wife's Cancer. The Last 3 Photos Destroyed Me.](http://www.viralnova.com/wifes-cancer/)

    From Angelo’s blog: “I remember the exact moment…Jen’s voice and the
    numb feeling that enveloped me. That feeling has never left. I’ll
    also never forget how we looked into each other’s eyes and held each
    other’s hands. ‘We are together, we’ll be ok.’”

    Throughout her battle, Angelo decided to photograph it. He wanted to
    humanize  the face of cancer on the face of his wife. The photos
    speak for themselves.

    It takes 10,000 hours to become an “expert in an ultra competitive
    field” but to go from “knowing nothing to being pretty good”,
    actually takes 20 hours. The equivalent of 45 minutes a day for a
    month.

    UN Women uses real Google searches to highlight Global Sexism: The
    campaign uses the world's most popular search engine (Google) to
    show how gender inequality is a worldwide problem. The adverts show
    the results of genuine searches, highlighting popular opinions
    across the world wide web

    My commute is a journey. A journey toward finding the right balance
    between the two cities. This is Bangalore. The city offers you
    everything you need and sits back and watches while you imprudently
    pick only what you want.
