South Central Railways(SCR) has banned photography in stations, as
a measure to prevent Terrorism. Terrorism by definition is "the
act of terrorizing; a mode of government by terror or
intimidation." Doesn't this decision by SCR define a victory for
the people they are trying to stop?

Anyway, if you are carrying a camera and are tempted to shoot in
the railway station, go get a permission letter from the Chief
PRO. :-/
