Revelations..Revelations...Revelations.

Such wonderful things they are... bringing to us.. such a joy
[even if its about something not so pleasant...]... the joy of
discovering things.. of realising a truth... that was hidden
somewhere within... brought out with an elegant swoooosh!!...

We, 9, Voodoo, Ravi, UC n me] were just walking on the
street... enjoying the evening... after a nice day @ Quark [Day
2]... We were having a casual discussion... not discussing
anything in particular... but somehow the discussion led to a
project uc,ravi n me [ and probably the others are too..(they
didn't talk abt it...)] are interested in... [i don't wanna give
any more info abt the project.. bcos it may seem over-ambitious to
a few.. not that it hasn't been done already.... but...]
neways....

so... while we were talkin abt it... uc said, he didn't have any
clue about that thing worked... and we all were wondering
too... thinking about some possible solutions/methods....[I was
actually trying to recollect something i came across... some time
back...] but then suddenly 9 jumped in, to say...

> Don't think about how 'that' works... Just think about how 'YOU'
> would make it work!!

Oh my God!! now that's what's a REVELATION... I was just
dumb-struck... that one small statement of his... drowned me in
its depths... I feel I still haven't come out of it... A big big
revelation at the most unexpected of times, at the most unexpected
of places.... [though 9 wouldn't agree with this... being his
usual modest self...]

Its been proved time and again... "they" can occur
anywhere... anytime and to anyone... while you are on the
street.. in your room.. at work... or even in the loo... [Most ppl
have a lot of them here!!].. we just need to keep our eyes n ears
open... and most importantly our Mind......  ps: it seems...me not
delving out the details about our ambitious project.. makes this
post a little vague, uninteresting n difficult to relate to... but
still...  In the fields of observation chance favors only the
prepared mind --Louis Pasteur
