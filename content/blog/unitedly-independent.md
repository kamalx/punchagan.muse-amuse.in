First things first...

स्वतंत्रता दिनोत्सव की शुभकामनायें

Wish You All a Happy Independence Day..

స్వాతంత్ర  దినోత్సవ  శుభాకాంక్షలు...

[yes, I know just three of the eighteen... and no foreign ones.. ]

Every year, during this time of the year, the papers and news and
blogs and all other such media, are filled with analyses,
comments, opinions and all sorts of things on the progress made
(and not made) by Independent India.... the flavour of patriotism
that was only subtle all this while, tends to grow upon us as the
Day arrives and I'm no exception.

Being an average Indian, just one amongst the Billion, the
progress (or non-) is a very big issue for me to comment on and I
would leave that job for the better qualified or the more
courageous ones. But I wonder, I (just) wonder.....

Come August and its the beginning of a new semester, bringing
along "Elections" in campus. This time is no different... I can
see people gearing up.... campaigning has begun even before the
announcement of elections or nominations... and what goes on here?

-   "Dude.. I don't need to campaign.. there's enough guys from our state in our hostel.. so contesting= winning.. don't worry!"
-   "Look dude.. both of us are from the same state.. so I know you will be obviously voting for me.. but still if you want, you can have a look at my Agenda... "
-   "Hey, its not important for me to tell you my agenda... its sufficient for you to know that my opponent hails from the other half of the country (North-South)where we hail from..
-   "People.. we need to make sure that only one person, belonging to our state contests for this post... or the votes will get divided"

Where are those ideals of unity and brotherhood? Isn't it
important that the best person be chosen? Shouldn't the abilities
of a candidate be considered rather than where (s)he hails from or
what tongue (s)he speaks? Isn't it an irony, that all this happens
precisely during this time, when the whole nation is celebrating
the birth of an Independent India?? Shouldn't at least the
celebrations be able to evoke the emotions of brotherhood, love
and equality amongst us?? Shouldn't the fact that all of us are
here with a purpose, a common goal of education, enough to get
over the differences of language and origin? Shouldn't the
interests of the College and the Students overpower such minor
issues??
