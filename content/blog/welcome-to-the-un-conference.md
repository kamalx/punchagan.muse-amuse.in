**Here comes the WikiCamp!!**

Its all about understanding and harnessing the power of wikis...

It aims to bring together the best minds from the Wiki/Internet
space to talk about issues,opportunities,future and evolution of
this powerful tool...

Demystifying terms like Collaborative Knowledge Sharing, Wisdom of
Crowds, Crowd Sourcing...

To enliven the "Spirit of Sharing".... [That's what it means to
me!]

The event is scheduled for the 25th of February, and the venue is
at Tidel Park, Chennai.

Who's the Organiser?? Everyone is. WikiCamp runs as an
unconference, where everyone is an organizer and there is no
passive audience. So it is as much your event.The overall
co-ordination is being done by The Knowledge Foundation, the same
group behind events such as Barcamp Chennai, Blogcamp and
Proto.in.

I am a Promoter of this event... You can be one too.... just write
a post in your blog space... and help in telling the world about
it...

Wanna Participate?
