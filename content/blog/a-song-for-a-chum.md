Pray for me brother<br />
Pray for me brother<br />
Pray for me sister<br />
Are you searchin'...<br />
Pray for me brother<br />
<br />
Lookin' for the answers To all the questions In my life<br />
Will I be alone Will you be there By my side<br />
Is it something he said Is it something he did<br />
I wonder why He is searchin’ For the answers<br />
To stay alive<br />
<br />
Could you ever listen Could you ever care<br />
To speak your mind<br />
Only for a minute For only one moment<br />
In time<br />
<br />
The joy is around us But show me the love<br />
That we must find<br />
Are you searchin' For a reason to be kind, to be kind…<br />
He said... Pray for me brother<br />
<br />
Pray for me brother Pray for me sister<br />
Pray for me brother Say<br />
what you wanna say now<br />
But keep your hearts open<br />
Be what you wanna be now<br />
Let's heal the confusion<br />
Pray for me brother<br />
<br />
Don't let me take When you don’t wanna give<br />
Don't be afraid Just let me live<br />
Don't let me take When you don’t wanna give<br />
Don't be afraid Say what you wanna say now<br />
But keep your hearts open<br />
<br />
Be what you wanna be now Let's heal the confusion<br />
Pray for me brother Pray for me brother<br />
I'm ashamed ah, brother be dying of poverty<br />
when he down on his knees its only then he prays<br />
And it's a shame ah, brother be dying of ignorance<br />
cos the world is a trip and everybody’s a hypocrite<br />
Need to stop ah , taking a look at the other<br />
I'm not ashamed of poverty<br />
need to be making his life better<br />
So think about it, think about it once more<br />
cos life is a blessing and it's not justa show, ah<br />
Round and round the world is spinning around<br />
<br />
We need to be singing a prayer, we need to be singing it now<br />
Round and round the world is turning around<br />
We need to be singing a prayer, we need to be singing it now<br />
Need to be feeling the power, need to be feeling the faith<br />
We need to coming together just to win this race<br />
<br />
Need to be feeling the power, need to be feeling the faith<br />
We need to coming together just to win this race (twice)<br />
Are you searching for a reason to be kind ?<br />
