I like the idea of pair blogging. Cate and Sacha, seem to be doing
it (intentionally or not). One person blogs on a topic he/she's
presently thinking about and the other person posts his/her views
on the same issue.  Well, comments are meant for that, but a blog
post seems to give you greater freedom.

PS: I called it pair-blogging. I don't know if it already has a
name or if pair-blogging means something else.
