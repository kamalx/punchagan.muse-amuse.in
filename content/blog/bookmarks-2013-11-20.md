-   [When Success Comes To You Easily | Amitbanerjee.net](http://amitbanerjee.net/complacency/)

    The biggest trap that you can fall into is if you can be successful
    without giving your 100 percent in whatever you are doing.

-   [Why Generation Y Yuppies Are Unhappy | Wait But Why](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wait-but-why/generation-y-unhappy_b_3930620.html)

    Here's my advice for Lucy:

    1.  Stay wildly ambitious. The current world is bubbling with
        opportunity for an ambitious person to find flowery, fulfilling
        success. The specific direction may be unclear, but it'll work
        itself out -- just dive in somewhere.

    2.  Stop thinking that you're special. The fact is, right now, you're
        not special. You're another completely inexperienced young person
        who doesn't have all that much to offer yet. You can become
        special by working really hard for a long time.

    3.  Ignore everyone else. Other people's grass seeming greener is no
        new concept, but in today's image crafting world, other people's
        grass looks like a glorious meadow. The truth is that everyone
        else is just as indecisive, self-doubting, and frustrated as you
        are, and if you just do your thing, you'll never have any reason
        to envy others.

-   [python sweetness — Use of logging package from within a library](http://pythonsweetness.tumblr.com/post/67394619015/use-of-logging-package-from-within-a-library)

    Python’s standard logging package is a really wonderful thing, but
    unfortunately some of its key ideas aren’t clearly documented in a
    large enough point font.

-   [Alex Gaynor -- Effective Code Review](http://alexgaynor.net/2013/sep/26/effective-code-review/)

    Code review is an important part of a healthy engineering culture
    and workflow. Hopefully, this post has given you an idea of either
    how to implement it for your team, or how to improve your existing
    workflow.
