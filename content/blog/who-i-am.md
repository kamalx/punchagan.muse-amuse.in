I'm not the body that dies<br />
on missing a beat or one breath.<br />
I'm not the mind, so fickle,<br />
I'm in heaven one moment, and next in hell.<br />
<br />
I'm the moments I live,<br />
not the ones, in which I just exist.<br />
I'm the dreams I dream,<br />
those fulfilled, and not just yet.<br />
<br />
I am the occasions I grace<br />
and those, missed, where I am.<br />
I am the words I spoke,<br />
those I wrote, and those I will.<br />
<br />
I am all that I create,<br />
and the stuff that I catalyse.<br />
I am the love I receive,<br />
and all of it that I spread.<br />
<br />
Don't cry, when I die,<br />
for I never really will.<br />
