This post is to promote QUARK'07... This post is here... little
due to my desire.. and almost totally bcos somebody [the ppl here
at coll..] expect "us" to do it..

Blogspot.. Orkut..[i don't use it any more] were blocked on campus
[don't ask why cos none of us have been able to figure
out.. atleast about Blogspot..] but the blocks have been lifted
for a fortnight.. just so that we can publicise Quark [our
techfest..] Its from 17th March to 19th March.. check out the link
for more details..

So ppl.. Quark coming up :)...

and... blocks coming up too :(...

[But why Blogspot???]
