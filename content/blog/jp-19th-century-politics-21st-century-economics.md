lot of nurturing.  Let us be engaged. It is our future that's on
the line. Economic growth is spurring changes in the
country. Communications revolution is helping bring change.  The
question is, What direction of change?  I ask of you, to make a
difference to the way the Indian political trajectory takes
shape.
