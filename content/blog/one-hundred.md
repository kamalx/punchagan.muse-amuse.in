suggested, I just want to say Yay! and thank my readers!

I'd like to thank all the people who gave me those small nudges to
write something down here and hope at least one person has found
something useful here.

Thanks to all the people dropping in here, regularly; Bearing with
whatever sort of stuff I put up here. :)

blogging.]
