This is a free world,<br />
you are free to will and whim,<br />
can it, at the cost of,<br />
your brother n his freedom,be?<br />
<br />
Life is price'less',<br />
the big shots say, we realize.<br />
is it why, you sell ya brethren's life,<br />
cheaply, for personal gain?<br />
<br />
The human'kind', we call ourselves,<br />
aren't the rivers, the air,<br />
the forests or our mother earth,<br />
worthy of our acts of kindness?<br />
<br />
We are making rapid strides,<br />
from the micro to the nano,<br />
is it just in sci &amp; tech, or does<br />
it coop in our loves and lives too?<br />
<br />
The world's a small place,<br />
the wise and learned say,<br />
is that why, not all have,<br />
a roof, under which to stay?<br />
<br />
Its a world of press n media,<br />
is it why we are pressed at,<br />
with news that's dubious,<br />
in truth and worth as well?<br />
<br />
We are all for world peace, they say,<br />
do you alone, make up "the world"? I ask<br />
How else would war, uncalled for<br />
bring about world peace?<br />
<br />
I want my piece is all I hear.<br />
