A DJ nite's going on here.. for WAVES.... I just went there for a
while....  The arrangements were pretty good... with Huge huge
huge spks.. [I can still hear the Music quite loud.. sitting here
in my room.. which is quite a distance form the Venue...] There's
real Heart throbbing music [Literally... With speakers of over
15000W your heart really throbs... dub.. dub.. dub...] being
played there...

I was just wondering if we really needed such extravagant
stuff... I know that such events bring ppl together... but do we
need to spend so much money just to have a have a good dance with
friends?? When a large number of people aren't able to get their
basic neccessities like a Square Meal, Clean drinking water,
proper clothing and shelter... here we are enjoying a good dance
with friends... with elaborately made extravagant
arrangements... [of course the money isn't ours... but...] [ I
know a lot of guys wud've a lot to say against me.... but.. its
ok..]

There can't be perfect equality in this world... of which duality
is an integral part.... every elementary particle has a dual
nature... so its but obvious that every thing in this world has a
dual to it... so its not possible to have a perfect world with
everybody equally placed.. if there is a rich.. then there will be
a poor... if there is joy.. then there will be despair... if there
is light.. then there will be darkness...

But can't we do anything... can't we spread the light to every
place that we possibly could?? Can't we get together to minimize
the difference? Join the race against nature... do your bit...

This, probably, is a good place to start off...
