<p class="verse">
the time, together spent,<br />
the memories cherished,<br />
all the love, concern and care<br />
may they stay with us, for life.<br />
<br />
as high and far as you like<br />
may you fly, like you own the sky<br />
while I fumble, with my flying guide<br />
I see the world, through your eyes<br />
<br />
may you run, with all your might<br />
as if, fighting for life, you are.<br />
struggling to walk, I stumble and fall,<br />
but get up each time, inspired to run.<br />
<br />
may you, in all that we shared<br />
find strength to go on, if en-route<br />
our paths diverged; you may have to wait,<br />
but you shall see me, on the other side!<br />
</p>

Thanks to Chaitu, I re-read Love Unvoiced a few times and
realized, I was trying to say too much. Here's another poem,
with one part of what I wanted to say. I will not be writing
newer poems, to say the other stuff. Perform your own Fourier
analysis.
