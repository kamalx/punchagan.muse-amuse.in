~~I'd~~ We had been on a 60 km long trip today. My second one, and
Ritesh's first. The map of our route is here. On the whole the ride
was wonderful! A thoroughly enjoyable one. It was near perfect, with
it raining only as much as we enjoyed an not anymore. :)

-   The ride on Godbander Road was the most enjoyable part of the
    ride. Simple Wonderful! That's what made the trip worth it!

-   It was more relaxed than my previous ride and it took us about 5
    hours on the whole. We must've been pedalling for about 4 hours. I
    don't have the "actual" figures.

-   Except for the stretch of Western express highway (service road)
    from Jogeshwari to a little after the Sanjay Gandhi National park's
    entrance, the road was decent. The Eastern Express highway service
    road was awesome!

-   Cycling alone is totally different from cycling with someone
    else. We didn't really go together, but we were meeting up once in a
    while. The loneliness, of rides on which you are alone, is
    absent. But waiting for, or catching up with the other guy is a bit
    tricky. I wonder how it would be with a bigger group.

-   I tried to keep going at about 60% effort and I still had quite a
    bit of juice left in me, at the end of the ride.

-   My cycle is definitely good! I really only understood this after
    exchanging my cycle.

-   Exchanging cycles felt nice. A slightly different set of muscles
    were in action. The newness kinda helped.

-   I should probably get myself a bigger round frame spectacles. Or I'm
    craning my neck a bit too much, to keep looking ahead, while
    pedaling. How about contacts?

-   The problem with riding on the left of Highways is that you
    "compete" with heavy vehicles. It sometimes gets a bit scary.

-   I should get a helmet soon.

-   I should get in touch with local cycling groups and tag along with
    them on a couple of rides. I'll get to learn a lot of things.

-   Ritesh took a few pics with his phone. ~~Photos in some later post or
    with an update~~.

-   Where to next? A ride inside the National park, probably or the
    wonderful roads of Navi Mumbai.

Kudos Ritesh!

**UPDATE:** A few pictures, that Ritesh clicked on his phone. All the
photos were on the Godbander Road.
