title : "Obesity in India"
draft : false

Based on the National Family Health Survey - 4 (2015-16) [^fn:1], the obesity
in India is at 20.7% for Women and 18.6% for Men. To put this in perspective,
every 1 in 5 Indian women is obese and the proportion of obese men is slightly
less than that.

In both women and men, the Urban population seems to be twice as obese as the
rural population. About 31% of women are obese while about 26% of men are obese.
Across all of the states and districts individually, the urban population seems
to be more likely to be obese than the rural folk. Sedentary lifestyles have
been known to be one of the leading causes for
obesity [^fn:2]<sup>, </sup>[^fn:3], and such lifestyles
becoming a norm of the Urban life could explain this trend. Since, the
prevalence of obesity seems to be much higher in the Urban areas, we shall
restrict further discussion to Urban areas.

In general, the obesity of men and women by area seems to be highly correlated,
i.e., areas with a high population of obese women also seems to have a high
fraction of men who are obese, and vice-versa. In most places, the fraction of
women who are obese seems to be higher than the number of obese men.

While there could be other gender based differences, that could be contributing
to this, it seems likely that the low Female Labor Force Participation (FLFP)
could be one the strong contributors to this. India has a FLFP of 15% in the
Urban areas (2011-12) [^fn:4], while about 56% of Urban men participate in the
labor force. Given the Urban facilities, it seems quite likely that the
non-working Urban woman has a more sedentary/inactive lifestyle, as compared to
that of a working Urban man. One notable exception to this rule is Sikkim, where
the men seem to be more likely to be obese than the women. Is it a coincidence
that Sikkim has been ranked as the best place for women to
work? [^fn:5]

Guntur and Vijayawada which are only about 40km away from seem to be the cities
with the biggest fraction of obese women, where every 1 in 2 women is obese.
Other cities in Telengana and Andhra Pradesh also seem to have significantly
high proportion of obese women. Cultures and lifestyles of these states seem to
tend to make people obese, but it is also notable that Guntur and Vijayawada
have been found to be alarmingly polluted [^fn:6], and that could be one of
the reasons for higher obesity prevalence [^fn:7] in these cities as
compared to other cities in the state.
