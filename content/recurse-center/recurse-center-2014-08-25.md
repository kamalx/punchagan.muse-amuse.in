-   I spent some time cleaning up my [gitqus](https://github.com/punchagan/crumb) code.  I plan to try it out on a
    "real site" today, and do a little polish of the UI.

-   I worked with Dana and Marcus fixing a bunch of issues with the [HS LED
    Screen](https://github.com/marqsm/LED-bot). I might work on it for a little bit today, doing a little more
    clean-up of the architecture.

-   The Monday talk was Mary live coding a space invaders game.  It was a fun
    talk, that was very well planned.

-   During the walk to the talk, Bert, Maia and I were talking about the idea of
    a School where projects were the atom of the curriculum, instead of courses.

-   I'll spend some time preparing my talk for tonight's hack-and-tell.
