-   Micheal demo-ed paredit mode in the emacs-club meetup, and I learnt a bunch
    of things I didn't know about it.
-   I added simpler tests (just one test, really) for `cinspect` using a dummy
    module, and Tom started reviewing the code.  I wrapped up the code (for now),
    until there is further interest in the project (in the form of issues/feature
    requests).  I haven't yet announced it anywhere, but I probably should.
-   I helped Teja (a friend of mine, not in HS) with a simple function to use
    bisection to solve an equation.  He's just starting off with Python, and am
    looking forward to see where he goes with it!
-   I learned a few things about the V8 code base, thanks to sitting next to
    Marcus, who is poking around with it.
-   I started looking for other things to do, and went through a little bit of
    the Audio programming book, but didn't do it for too long, until I stumbled
    on [Think Complexity](http://greenteapress.com/complexity/) and started reading it.  I read the introduction, and got
    through a few of the exercises on Graphs.
-   I also played around Flask-Sockets to help figure out answers to some
    questions on Zulip, and was able to get a [Hello World](https://gist.github.com/punchagan/53600958c1799c2dcf26) working.
-   In the process, I discovered the awesomeness of the gist-mode in emacs.  I
    had always wanted gist plugins to let me list and update my previous gists,
    but most of the plugins didn't seem to have it, or the feature wasn't very
    discoverable.  I had tried writing something like that for Canopy, one or two
    years ago.  Discovering that gist mode has this feature, was awesome!
