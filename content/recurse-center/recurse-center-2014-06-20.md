-   Fridays are optional in Hacker School, and people are given help
    with preparation for job interviews.
-   This week's exercise was a "know-your-language" type exercise and I
    decided to do it with Haskell, and confirmed the fact that I didn't
    know it too well. :)
-   I spent the afternoon writing the blog-post on [OAuth2](./oauth2-demystified.md), and adding
    support for converting ditaa code blocks to png using Pygments.  It
    may not have been the best use of time, but anyway...
