-   I spent most of the day refactoring the code for the LED Bot, and am happy
    with the way it looks right now.
-   My talk at Hack and Tell went OK.  I was distracted by [live<sub>reveal</sub>](https://github.com/damianavila/live_reveal) not
    displaying properly on the smaller resolution, and not being able to mirror
    screens!
-   There were a bunch of interesting talks presented by the
    others. <http://comparea.org>, [Taxis and Rainbows](https://medium.com/@vijayp/of-taxis-and-rainbows-f6bc289679a1) were the most interesting
    ones for me.
