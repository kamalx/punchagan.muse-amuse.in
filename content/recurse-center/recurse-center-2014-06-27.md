-   This Friday we worked on building our own URL shorteners.  It was a fun
    exercise, and I built one that is not persistent, in the two hours.  I worked
    on a not so important problem of having sorted query parameters, instead of
    the more important problem of having a persistent server.  Anyway, I should
    be building something that works, first, before trying to solve the more
    interesting problems.  At least on Fridays.
-   I watched this old but interesting talk by Brandon Rhodes, titled [The Mighty
    Dictionary](http://pyvideo.org/video/276/the-mighty-dictionary-55), and played around with his [\_dictinfo](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pycon2010-mighty-dictionary/blob/master/figures/_dictinfo.py) module after-wards.
-   I spent the rest of the evening reading up about Markov chains and Hidden
    Markov Models. I'm happy to finally understand what these terms mean, after
    seeing them being thrown around for so many years!
