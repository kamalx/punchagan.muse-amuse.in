-   I had gone to the emacs weekly meetup, and Samer demonstrated some of the
    things he liked, and discovered recently.
-   Stopped worrying too much about what the best way to index the data was, and
    just went about getting the tests running one by one.  There is still a small
    hack, but I got all the tests running except the source for modules.
-   At the end of the day, I thought I had the code to get all the tests passing,
    but I hit some unicode issues with json serializing, and don't have all the
    tests passing, yet.
-   I paired with Kyle to work through a simple example to generate a note of a
    specified frequency.
-   I spent some time reviewing my first month here, and wrote up some notes in
    preparation for the one-on-one today with Allison.
