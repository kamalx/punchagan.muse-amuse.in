-   I spent most of Saturday, thinking about what I should be doing for
    the next few weeks, and what I really want to get out of Hacker
    School.
-   I had a good discussion with Naren about things that he works on,
    and the kind of things that he sees as hard, what kind of things
    interest me, and what I want to do post Hacker School.  I always
    knew, I didn't really have an area of expertise or an area that I'm
    super interested in, where I want to work.  This discussion only was
    a verbalizing of those thoughts.
-   I am not sure, I am very happy with the way I have been learning
    Haskell.  The UPenn course has been reasonably good with the
    exercises provided, and I have been learning through "pseudo"
    projects.  But, I'm wondering if I should pick up a more concrete
    project.
-   I played around a little bit with Elm and started something to try
    and write [Layout](https://github.com/huckerdom/layout) using Elm.
-   I tried cleaning up the phonebook problem from Friday. It works, but
    can definitely be improved with some help from a more experienced
    Haskeller.
