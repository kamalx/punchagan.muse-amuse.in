-   There seemed to be excitement in the space to have Jessica around.  We had
    coffee with her, and I chatted with her briefly. She encouraged me to try and
    send a patch to CPython, that involved debugging and fixing some C issues.
-   I spent some time with Tom, while he tried to get `cinspect` working for him,
    and it seemed like having the developer next to you, helped.  As always.  We
    didn't make any fixes to the code, but it worked.
-   I spent the afternoon, adding tests for a simple issue, to see how patches are sent.
-   Later, I paired with Sophia for an hour to refactor the vcs code. It's
    beginning to look much better than what it used to, and I like that.
-   Jessica's talk on buffer overflows was enlightening and entertaining. It was
    very similar to a talk that Max gave on one of the thursdays, but it was
    exciting nevertheless.
-   After the talk, I am inspired to try and work through the Hacking: Art of
    exploitation, at some point. I'm beginning to feel like time at HackerSchool
    running out!
