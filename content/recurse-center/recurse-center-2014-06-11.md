## Plan {#plan}

Continue with the Haskell tutorials, with additional reading from
Real World Haskell.


## Actual {#actual}

-   Finished exercises 4 and 5.
    -   Learnt about Type classes in Haskell and how to create them and
        make data types instances of them.
    -   Also came across a new algorithm of sieving called the [Sieve of
        Sundaram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Sundaram), which was discovered by a student.  Surprisingly, I
        never heard of it before!


## Miscellaneous {#miscellaneous}

-   A few of us had an interesting discussion about various places
    people grew up in and visited, and the cultures, etc.
-   Idea: implement a GitHub dashboard for organizations (say, HS
    batches) that give you different statistics, and interesting
    graphs. (Use elm?) [Update: Tom is working on HS and GitHub
    integration. So, that's perfect!]
