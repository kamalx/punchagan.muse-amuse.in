## C stuff {#c-stuff}

-   In the morning I cleaned up the code to open torrent files, and parse them.
-   I worked on a function to do encode text properly, and Sophia helped me
    find out that I had to use unsigned chars in it.
-   I looked at Sophia's threaded ftp server in C, and gave some suggestions on
    how the code could be refactored.


## Baking Pi {#baking-pi}

-   We still didn't get to the video stuff, yesterday.  We finished the first 5
    chapters, though, and have a SOS pattern display.
-   I'm really looking forward to doing the cool video stuff.


## Miscellaneous {#miscellaneous}

-   William Skeith, gave a talk on [using SSH keys for web-authentication](https://github.com/wes1138/webauth-via-ssh), which
    was pretty interesting.
