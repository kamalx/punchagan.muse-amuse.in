-   Didn't do anything during the weekend.  Hopefully, this won't be the
    case all of the weekends.  I had fun with my cousins, though.
-   Denise is already working on a twitter app that sounds similar to
    the idea I had.
-   I accidentally discovered that evince supports vim-like keybindings,
    which is cool.
-   When writing patterns for a function it helps to write the most
    general case first, and then write the edge cases.
-   I was feeling a little unproductive in the afternoon and I ended up
    attending Zach's talk on [Community](https://github.com/hackerschool/community).  I got a brief overview of the
    whole architecture, and got to know a little bit about reactjs and
    om. I don't think I'll get around to contributing to the project,
    since most of the stack is totally new to me, and I'm not
    particularly inclined to learn those things now.
-   I was working on Monoids for most part of the day and got through
    exercise 7.  I started doing the I/O exercise around the end of the
    day.
-   The day ended with a talk on jobs related stuff by Nick and Sonali.
    It seems super unlikely for me to get a job (in the US), from what I
    understood from them.  So, I needn't worry too much about that and
    focus on getting better at Haskel and as a programmer in general.
