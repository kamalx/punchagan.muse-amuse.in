## Yesterday {#yesterday}

-   It was exciting to have so many new Hacker Schoolers in the space.  But, the
    excitement was kinda distracting too.

-   I spent most of the day looking at shairport, and libshairport and trying to
    wrap it, so I can use it to get data for the spectrum analyzer via the
    Air-play protocol.  I was able to call it using `ctypes`, but it doesn't seem
    discoverable.

-   I also briefly looked at Julia and [dwm](http://dwm.suckless.org), to try and port dwm to Julia.  It
    doesn't seem like too much work, but is going to take me a while given how
    comfortable I'm with both Julia and C.

-   Yaron Minsky's talk on distributed systems was a great introduction to
    Distributed systems.

-   After the talk, I spent a little time updating my notes from an old org-mode
    workshop to present it at the emacs user group meet up today.


## Today {#today}

-   I hope to get the spectrum analyzer to use `libshairport` and be able to play
    music sent through Air play.

-   Spend some time talking to the emacs user group about org-mode.

-   If I have any time, after getting this to work, I may play around with the
    dwm port.
