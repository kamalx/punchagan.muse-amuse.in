-   I spent most of the day working through David Beazly's tutorials on
    generators and coroutines, and it was mind bending.
-   I learnt about `send` and `throw` methods on generators!  I hadn't heard of
    them before, and was totally surprised to come across them.
-   I spent a little time late in the day getting class diffs working, and
    refactoring the api-diff tool to remove duplication of code between classes
    and modules. But, not very happy with the way I did it.
