-   I added an additional view to xtab, to see all the pages that were killed,
    and reopen them, if you so choose.
-   Also, cleaned up the `api-diff` project and renamed it to [what-changed](https://github.com/punchagan/what-changed).
-   Started thinking about building the GitHub organization dashboard, that I
    thought would be interesting to have, since the 1st or 2nd week of Hacker
    School.
-   A bunch of awesome thursday presentations, and job fair and awesome food by
    Chef Warren!
