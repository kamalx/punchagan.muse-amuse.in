-   I refactored the API-diff code, and am pretty happy with what I have right
    now, and need to add support for diffing Classes. I'm considering using
    [Atstroid](http://www.astroid.org) instead of Python's `ast` module, since some of the work that I want
    to do, has already been done for me.
-   With the white-boarding group, we worked on a set of simple exercises for
    strings and arrays.
-   Jos√© Valim's presentation on Elixir was interesting and got me reading up a
    stuff about concurrency, and related stuff.  Thanks!
