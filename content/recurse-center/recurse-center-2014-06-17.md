-   I've been bookmarking the interesting links that people post on
    Zulip and have a lot of reading to do.   It would be nice if I had
    an easy way to send stuff on to my kindle. (pdfs, html, etc.).
    Instapaper works, but doesn't work as well as I would like it to.  I
    just want a simple script that takes a list of urls and does the
    right thing.  May be I will write something that uses Calibre, or
    even better someone already has.
-   I worked through exercises 08 and 10 of the haskell course,
    yesterday.
-   Chapter 8 was about how IO works in haskell.  The exercise didn't
    involve too much, except I wasted a lot of time on tracking a
    stupidity of mine.
-   The next part of the course was an introduction to Functors,
    Applicative and Alternative.  I'm not sure I totally understand and
    am comfortable with them, but I have been able to get through the
    exercises.
-   I think it's time for me to start working on some Elm tutorials,
    along with the Haskell exercises.
-   Also, I had questions about when to use `type`, `newtype` and `data`
    and incidentally found [this section](http://learnyouahaskell.com/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids#the-newtype-keyword) that ended with the following
    summary: "If you just want your type signatures to look cleaner and
    be more descriptive, you probably want `type` synonyms. If you want
    to take an existing type and wrap it in a new type in order to make
    it an instance of a type class, chances are you're looking for a
    `newtype`.  And if you want to make something completely new, odds
    are good that you're looking for the `data` keyword."
