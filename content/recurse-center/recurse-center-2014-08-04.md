-   A bunch of worked on getting LEDs to blink, by writing some assembly code.

-   I goofed off post-lunch, and cleaned up the code for the Google Translate
    based TTS client.

-   I tried to continue working on the bencode parser, to add support for
    dictionaries, but I couldn't get much work done before it was time for the
    Monday talk.
