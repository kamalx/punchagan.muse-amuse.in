-   We worked on writing our own (toy) version control system on Friday, as a
    part of job prep.  I paired with Sophia, and we got upto the point where we
    had diffs working, when we decided to refactor the code with some tests and
    stuff.
-   The party was brilliant with a lot of activity.  All the project
    installations looked so cool, and it was so much fun!
-   I spent some time during the weekend watching the "Anatomy of Matplotlib"
    lectures.
-   I started some work with poking around Matplotlib's template backend, and
    trying to start writing and ascii backend.
-   Also, I was trying to help UC setup [GrooveBasin](https://github.com/andrewrk/groovebasin) on his raspberry pi, and
    helped him configure [jasper](https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client) on it.
