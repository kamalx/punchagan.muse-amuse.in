-   Amber [talked about](http://www.subsymbol.org/2014/06/hacker-school-tuesday-june-17th-2014.html) "exploring only until the current task is done"
    and moving on, which is could really be a lost opportunity to learn
    something new and gain a better understanding of the system I am
    working with.
-   Having something (anything not directly related to the current
    project I'm working on) scheduled for later in the day, doesn't seem
    to do me much good. I feel distracted for quite a long period before
    the scheduled time.
-   Abstractions and layers were talked about in the second exercise on
    Applicatives... Layering, FTW!
-   I spent about an hour or so in the afternoon reading the paper, [One
    VM to rule them all](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/gkrichar/papers/onward2013-wuerthinger-truffle.pdf).  It talked about Truffle: an API to implement
    an AST parser for any language and Graal: a JIT compiler for the
    ASTs.  Later in the day, I also went to the [Papers we love](http://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love/events/178049922/) meetup.
    The presentation and the talks were quite interesting!
-   I also started looking at [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) and playing with it.
