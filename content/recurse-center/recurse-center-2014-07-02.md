-   I pushed the code onto [github](https://github.com/punchagan/cinspect) to let Allison and Tom review it, and Tom was
    quite excited by the idea of having it.
-   I added a startup script in IPython, to monkey-patch it to use my code for
    introspection.
-   Having never written a C-extension, I read up the Python docs on [writing C
    extensions](https://docs.python.org/2/extending/extending.html), and played around a little with [pycparser](https://github.com/eliben/pycparser/), but it didn't seem to
    work too well with the Python's sources.
-   I later went to the New York Public Library to see [a copy of the Declaration
    of Independence in Thomas Jeffersonâ€™s hand.](http://www.nypl.org/press/press-release/2013/06/26/new-york-public-library-display-historic-copies-declaration-independe)
