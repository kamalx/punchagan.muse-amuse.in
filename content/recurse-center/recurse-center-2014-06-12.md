-   Came to know about the project that Tom is working on for being able
    to auth integration of GitHub and Hacker School.  This will be useful
    for me, when I get to working on the GitHub dashboard.
-   I spent an hour or so to clean up by blog workflow and help scripts
    to insert tags in Nikola posts, etc.  I also have a [script](https://github.com/punchagan/home-bin/blob/master/hs-post) to make a
    post for each day, automatically.
-   lolcommit is an interesting project, and Max is using it for logging
    his work at Hacker School.
-   Learned about laziness and the consequences of it. You cannot have
    side-effects, in a lazy language, if you want to keep the sanity of
    the developers using your language.
-   Pattern matching forces evaluation.
-   Also, briefly read about `seq`, halting problem and `bottom` from
    the Haskell wiki.
-   The week ended with presentations by Hacker Schoolers from this
    batch.  It was also Alum day, so we had some Alumni visiting.  I
    missed half of the presentations because I had to leave early for
    Suguna's graduation.

I hope to continue to do some work on the tutorials during the
weekend, and get back to it and finish them next week.
