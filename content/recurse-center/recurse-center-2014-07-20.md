## Saturday & Sunday {#saturday-and-sunday}

-   During the weekend, I had this idea of building a personalized "radio" for
    myself using a Raspberry pi.  The idea is to have a service where all my
    bookmarks, and feeds are accumulated to, instead of eating up valuable
    browser tab real estate.  And then, I could use a Raspberry pi to randomly
    play content off of it, based on a theme.

-   I worked on getting things together for it, during the weekend.  The project
    is more like a "thing that needs to be done", rather than something that puts
    me out of my comfort zone, atleast as far as I can see. So, I'm just going to
    work on it as a background thing, between other projects, etc.

-   Festival seemed OK initially, while I was trying things out, but when I
    actually used it to read me a blog post, it was really terrible!  I tried
    demos of a few commercial tools, and they seem much better than what festival
    had to offer.  I wonder what it would take to get Festival, up there.  I
    tried using Google's translate service's tts (unofficial API) and it seemed
    so good!  But, it limits each request to 100 bytes, and the audio will have
    to be downloaded via the Network.

-   Madhu pointed me to MaryTTS, which seemed to be an active project and it
    seemed to be much better than Festival, though not as good as Google's tts.
    I'm going to try getting it to run on a Pi, next.


## Monday {#monday}

-   I don't really know what I'm doing to work on, today.  I have been playing
    around with the Pi, for the past week-ish, and it has been fun!  Kyle and I
    will probably work more on tweaking it, to get it to work the way we want
    it, for the party!

-   I also did a little bit of Julia with Sean, and it was fun.  I may try
    playing around with it, a little bit, but not sure what to work on.  May be
    continue working through the think-complexity book using Julia?

-   Or jump into something I totally don't know about, inspired by listening to
    Julia Evans' podcast for Ruby Rogues.  I just got this idea of trying to
    write a window manager to understand how X works, and what wayland is...  I
    could try porting dwm or i3wm to Julia.

-   There's a whole new bunch of excited Hacker Schoolers in the space, and its
    very exciting!
