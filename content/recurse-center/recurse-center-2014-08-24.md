## Friday {#friday}

-   I started playing around with React.js to see how I could build the GitHub
    organization dashboard, that I plan to.


## Saturday {#saturday}

-   Got a horrendous idea of implementing a disqus-like commenting system using
    GitHub's issue comments, and ran with it.  It seems technically feasible
    based on some initial implementation.  I need to clean-up/rewrite the
    prototype code on Monday.


## Sunday {#sunday}

-   Spent the day with cousins at Central Park Zoo, Upper East Side River
    front.
