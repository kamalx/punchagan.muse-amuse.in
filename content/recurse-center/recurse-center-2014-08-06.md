-   Finished working through the first 5 chapters of the baking pi course, and am
    excited to start working on the video stuff, today!
-   Spent some time pairing with Sindhu on her url checker, and later in the
    night helped her out with a small bug in her GitHub activity leaderboard
    script.
-   I spent some time adding dict parsing support to the bencode parser.
-   And also cleaned up the tests.
-   The electronics hobbyists were doing some cool stuff, and I joined them for a
    bit. We tried some cheap motion sensors, but they didn't work very well, and
    probably need to be calibrated.
