-   I continued with doing the initial parts of the book, and didn't pair with
    Stephanie today.
-   I gave a super-short presentation, introducing people to `pdb`, IPython's
    `tracer`.
-   I just started writing a Bencoding parser in C, but I'm having trouble
    thinking about all the memory allocations and stuff.  It feels so
    nostalgic! :P
