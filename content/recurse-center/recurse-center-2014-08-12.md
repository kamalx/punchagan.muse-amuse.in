-   An issue I was seeing with `pip` and a package installed in
    `system-site-packages` turned out to be non-reproducible.  It was probably
    PEBKAC.
-   I was wondering around in the morning trying to find something to work on.
-   I decided to work on Pankaj's idea to write a tool that gives you API
    differences between two versions of a library.  It would be useful to have
    the list of public API changes in a library you use, to estimate the cost of
    updating to the newer version, without having to manually go through all the
    changes.
-   I spent some time talking to Sophia, and looking at her FTP server's
    refactored code.
