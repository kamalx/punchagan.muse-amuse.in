I came super early to try and get some work done in the quiet before
the daily checkins time.  Continued with the Haskell tutorial and
reading the Real World Haskell.

Finished a couple of exercises from the UPenn course, that were pretty
straight forward.

Also, finished a few exercises from chapter 3 of real world haskell,
and partially finished implementing Graham scan for generating a
convex hull for a set of points.

The exercises from both the places involved mainly learning about
Algebraic Data Types.

Mary pinged me to ask how the first couple of days were, and it was
good to talk to get a ping from her though I never talked to her.

I'm going to continue working on the Haskell exercises today.

I also got a couple of ideas for small projects:

-   Since, yelp is blocked from here, nobody can use yelp's API and work
    on any projects.  It may be helpful to have an API proxy server that
    runs on a different server and forwards any requests coming to it.
-   A simple script to create a twitter list for each batch of
    Hacker School.

Doing them in Python would be pretty straight forward. I will try to
work on these things in Haskell, once I'm reasonably comfortable with
Haskell.
