-   I happily let myself get distracted from all the math!  I had seen a [tweet](https://twitter.com/ballingt/status/483394809411825665) by
    Tom during the weekend, asking if there was any package that let users
    inspect C sources of builtin modules like ruby's [pry-doc](https://github.com/pry/pry-doc/)
-   I spent the morning playing around with pry-doc, reading its code, etc.
-   The latter part of the day was spent pairing with Tom, and figuring out what
    needs to be done to write a first cut version of something like this.  Ugly
    regexes, FTW! I have something that works for most of the stuff, it seems!
-   I also attended an interesting talk about Bit-torrent clients by an alum.
