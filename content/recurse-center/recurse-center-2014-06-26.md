-   I played around a little bit with my `emacs` configuration and got `jedi`
    working, with virtualenvs, thanks to `virtualenvwrapper.el`
-   Continue to work on the singal processing stuff and built a DTMF decoder
    using FFTs.  It's able to decode audacity generated audio, but not recorded
    ones. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, yet.
-   As with every Thursday, there were a bunch of interesting presentations:
    -   A rice cooker hooked up to an arduino in an afternoon!
    -   A presentation on how scopes act as monoids
    -   An implementation of [Eularian Video Magnification](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/)
    -   A regex engine visualizer using NetworkX.
    -   A [tag system to organize your files](https://github.com/ambimorph/protagonist)
    -   A web-socket based chat client
    -   A Go Parser written in Go
    -   ...
