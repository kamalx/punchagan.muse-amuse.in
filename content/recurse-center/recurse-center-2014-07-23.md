## Shairplay and WS2801 {#shairplay-and-ws2801}

-   Kyle mounted the LEDs onto a cardboard, and packaged it to look cool.

-   We thought we were done with the project, until we found out we weren't!  The
    LEDs all lighted up correctly, when we played the audio from a file on disk,
    but streaming messed something up!  Only the first few columns lighted up,
    when we were listening on the stream.

-   We spent the whole evening trying to debug the issue, and eliminated quite a
    few hypothesis, but weren't able to fix it, yet.


## Miscellaneous {#miscellaneous}

-   rntz live coded a parser for us yesterday, and I learnt a few things about
    parsers.  I'm glad I went to the discussion/talk.

-   I started working through the videos of Anatomy of Matplotlib, and hope to
    get new insights into how it works.


## Today {#today}

-   Today will be spent mostly trying to get streaming audio working.

-   I feel like debugging this, will take my understanding of the
    hardware-software interface to a new level.
