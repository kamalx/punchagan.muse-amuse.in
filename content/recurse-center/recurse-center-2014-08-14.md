-   I spent the morning cleaning up the "repr" functions of the diff classes, so
    that the diff of functions between two modules can be printed out in a
    somewhat meaningful way.

-   I spent most of the afternoon, preparing to make a small presentation on how
    `sys.path` works in Python.  I thought I didn't do as good a job of it, as I
    would've liked, but Tom thought it was not too bad...

-   Looks like another of those days, where I didn't get much done...  I spent
    the evening finishing off [Homeland](http://craphound.com/homeland/). It's a brilliant book, and everyone who
    cares about the Government and policies and technology MUST read it!  Thanks
    Cory.
