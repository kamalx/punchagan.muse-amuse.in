** TL; DR

- The ~global~ statement is a parser directive to indicate that ~globals~ are
  being used. When looking up ~globals~, the ~globals~ of the current scope are
  fetched.

- Python's ~globals~ are really just module-level.

- Every function has an associated ~__globals__~ dictionary, which is the *same
  as the module's ~__dict__~ for the module where it was defined*. This
  ~__globals__~ dict is the name-space that is looked up when trying to fetch
  ~globals~ within a function.

- Avoid globals to make it easier to test functions

** Motivation

During a mentoring session I was doing recently, we ran into a problem with
~globals~ in Python.

Here is a toy example to describe what we were seeing.

We had code in a module ~foo.py~ where the function ~f~ was using a global
defined in ~main~, and we were trying to write tests for the function ~f~.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # foo.py
  def f():
      print(a)


  def main():
      global a
      a = 5
      f()

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()
#+END_SRC

Running this file ~foo.py~ prints out ~5~ as expected.

We would now like to import ~f~ into a different module and use it.

** Running ~f~ in a different module

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # bar.py
  from foo import f

  def main():
      f()

  main()
#+END_SRC

Running the module ~bar.py~ gives us a ~NameError~, as expected. The name ~a~
was defined in the ~main~ in ~foo.py~ which is never being run when the code is
imported in ~bar.py~

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "bar.py", line 10, in <module>
      main()
    File "bar.py", line 7, in main
      f()
    File "foo.py", line 5, in f
      print(a)
  NameError: global name 'a' is not defined
#+END_SRC

** Setting a global value for ~a~

We'd like to be able to run ~f~ without running ~main~ and the first fix that
comes to mind is to set the value of ~a~ in ~bar~, and let ~f~ use that.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # bar.py
  def main():
      global a
      a = 4
      f()
#+END_SRC

Surprise! Nothing changes.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/tmp/example/bar.py", line 13, in <module>
      main()
    File "/tmp/example/bar.py", line 9, in main
      f()
    File "/tmp/example/foo.py", line 5, in f
      print(a)
  NameError: global name 'a' is not defined
#+END_SRC

Why doesn't this work?!

** Function ~__globals__~ and the ~global~ statement

The ~global~ statement is a directive to the parser, that specifies that the
variable being assigned to is a global variable.

This can be seen by looking at the disassembled code for ~f~

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import dis
  from foo import f

  dis.dis(f)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC asm
    5           0 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (print)
                2 LOAD_GLOBAL              1 (a)
                4 CALL_FUNCTION            1
                6 POP_TOP
                8 LOAD_CONST               0 (None)
               10 RETURN_VALUE
#+END_SRC

~globals~ for the current frame are fetched, and the value is updated in that
dict. Each function in Python has an associated ~__globals__~ dict which is a
reference to that module's ~__dict__~ in which the function was defined. So, in
the case where we try to set the ~a = 4~ in ~bar.main~, the ~main~ function's
~__globals__~ dict is being updated.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # bar.py
  def main():
      global a
      a = 4
      print(main.__globals__.keys())
      print(main.__globals__['a'])
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  dict_keys(['__name__', '__doc__', '__package__', '__loader__', '__spec__', '__annotations__', '__builtins__', '__file__', '__cached__', 'foo', 'f', 'dis', 'main', 'a'])
  4
#+END_SRC

As you can see ~a~ is being set to ~4~, but ~f~ still doesn't see value, since
it has it's own ~__globals__~ dictionary. Printing the ~globals~ dictionary for
~f~ should make that clear.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from foo import f
  print(f.__globals__)
#+END_SRC

If the variable ~a~ was declared in the module ~foo~ outside of any of the
functions, it would be in ~f~'s ~__globals__~ dict when it is imported, and
hence the name error would go away, but setting it still would not work.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # foo.py
  a = 3

  def f():
      print(a)


  def main():
      global a
      a = 5
      f()

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # bar.py
  from foo import f

  def main():
      global a
      a = 4
      f()

  main()
#+END_SRC

Running ~bar.py~ would print the value ~3~ which has been defined in ~foo.py~,
and not ~4~.

** Updating ~__globals__~

To update the value of ~a~ for ~f~, we could modify it's ~globals~ dict.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # bar.py
  from foo import f

  def main():
      f.__globals__['a'] = 4
      f()

  main()
#+END_SRC

** Module ~__dict__~ and monkey-patching

As mentioned previously, a function's ~__globals__~ dict is a reference to the
module's ~__dict__~ for the module where the function was defined. So, we could
achieve the same result as above by updating ~foo.__dict__~. And setting an
attribute on the module ~foo~ is the same as updating this dict.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # bar.py
  import foo
  from foo import f


  def main():
      foo.a = 4
      f()
#+END_SRC

If you have used a library like ~mock~ to patch some code while running tests,
this is essentially what is happening. The ~target~ module's dict is looked up
for the specified object/function and replaced with a mock object.

** Use an argument to make it testable

The function ~f~ would've been much easier to test, if it took ~a~ as an
argument, instead of using a global value. This functional approach would make
the code easier to reason about too.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # foo.py
  def f(a):
      print(a)


  def main():
      a = 5
      f(a)

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main()
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # bar.py
  from foo import f

  def main():
      a = 3
      f(a)
#+END_SRC

I was trying to lookup the documentation for [[http://click.pocoo.org/5/][Click]] and I got redirected to a
page showing Werkzeug's documentation. I'd assumed it was a broken configuration
on the server, because other subdomains like [[http://lucumr.pocoo.org][Armin's blog]] also sent me to the
same page. I [[https://twitter.com/punchagan/status/983885853343727616][got in touch with Armin]] and he asked me if I was using [[https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere][https
everywhere]], and that wasn't supported by the server. But, I wasn't. The next
thing to try was to switch my ISP and check, and viola it worked!

I did some debugging and figured out that in some responses the HTTP status line
was not being sent, and the first line in the response contained =Date=. Also,
the response seems to be correct, when I hit a hard refresh on the browser,
which sets the =Cache-Control= header to =no-cache=. So, it looks like some
cache in between me and the server is going nuts with this specific request.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ nc click.pocoo.org 80 < input.txt

  Last-Modified: Mon, 07 Apr 2014 18:35:36 GMT
  Connection: Keep-Alive
#+END_SRC

And the =input.txt= file looks like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC text

  Accept: */*
  Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip
  
#+END_SRC

Adding the line =Cache-Control: no-cache= to this input causes the problem to go
away.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ nc click.pocoo.org 80 < input.txt
  HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently

  Connection: keep-alive
  Location: http://sphinx-doc.org/
#+END_SRC

Also, I'm able to reproduce this with all the subdomains on =pocoo.org= -
=click=, =sphinx=, =lucumr=, ... I'm not sure if it has something to do with the
server, or if it is entirely independent of that. But, the problem does go away
when I switch to a different network.

I'm not sure what I can do next to narrow down the problem, even more. Any
hints/tips appreciated.

A bunch of us have recently started playing Badminton regularly (on weekends),
in Bangalore. We use [[https://playo.co/][Playo]] to book a court to play on. But, all of us live in
different parts of the city, and it's often difficult to find a convenient place
to play. Often, we end up in bad courts because we don't pay enough attention to
the ratings, while focusing on trying to find a court in a convenient location.

To help make this search easier, I built a [[https://punchagan.github.io/playo-find-venue/][small web app]] that shows the venues
from Playo on a map, and then allows you to specify the locations of players,
and the radius (in km) that they are willing to travel. Hopefully, we end up
finding a good court in the overlapping region. Clicking on the venue marker
allows you to jump to the Playo booking page for that venue. The source is
available [[https://github.com/punchagan/playo-find-venue/][here]].

- I usually go with [[http://leafletjs.com/][leaflet]] when I want to do map related stuff. This is the
  first time I used [[https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/][Google APIs]], and it was a pretty decent experience.
- I also ended up using the [[https://developers.google.com/url-shortener/][Google URL shortener API]] to make it easier to share
  URLs. The entire state of the app is being saved in the URL fragment, so that
  URLs are shareable, but it makes them long and ugly. Short URLs seemed like a
  good workaround.
- I got most of it working with vanilla javascript, until I started doing things
  where I felt it would be nice to have a light-weight two-way data and view
  binding library. I ended up trying [[http://knockoutjs.com/][knockoutjs]] for the first time, and enjoyed
  using it.
- The data for Playo venues is updated everyday using a [[https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/cron-jobs/][cron job that runs on
  Travis]]. So, the ratings of venues should be pretty up-to-date.
- But, Playo allows players to rate venues overall, and not by sport. So, it may
  so happen that the venue is a decent one overall, and has good facilities for
  some other sport, but the badminton courts are still bad. But, some venues are
  badminton only, and in those cases the ratings are more useful.
- It should be pretty easy to make the app [[https://github.com/punchagan/playo-find-venue/blob/68a39a1f0ed0e13f59a529fb28853bad360b95ba/js/places.js#L90][fetch data for other things]] like
  restaurants/movie theaters, to make this app do more than just help find Playo
  venues.

To Moar Badminton!

A few weeks ago, I was watching a talk title [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThhbt23SGM][Design is a Search Problem]] by
[[https://twitter.com/mbostock][@mbostock]] of d3 fame, which he gave a couple of years ago while he was still
working at the New York Times.

Primarily, he's trying to drive home the point that the process of coming up
with a good design (for a data visualization) is a hard problem -- there are a
few thumb rules and philosophical guidelines on how to come up with one, but
there are no silver bullets to come up with a good design for every scenario.

He makes the case for a process that lets you efficiently try out a lot of
designs to see what works and what doesn't. In the latter part of his talk he
goes on to demo an internal tool at NYT called Preview, that they use view,
explore and contribute to each others' work. I hoped that in the two years since
the talk was given, this tool would've been open-sourced, but it was not to be.

So, I started working on my own project, also called [[https://github.com/punchagan/preview][Preview]], that has a similar
set of features to those described in the talk. Even if I am not working in a
visualization team, I think it would be pretty useful to have such a tool to
explore the work of other people to learn more about their process, when coming
up with a visualization/design.

Currently, Preview lets you keep track of all the repositories of a single
user/organisation on GitHub. Any repository with an =index.html= file is assumed
to be a repository of interest, and tracked.

#+ATTR_HTML: :height 400px
#+ATTR_ORG: :height 400

[[file:~/Downloads/repo-listing.png]]

It also lets you view the screenshots for a repository over all the commits in
the repository. This is intended to be some sort of a visual version of git log.

[[file:~/Downloads/screenshots-delhi-traffic-story.png]]

You can also view any repository at the latest commit on any branch.

file:~/Pictures/preview-branches.png

The tool is pretty new and quite brittle right now, but already quite functional
and useful, I think. If you do give it a spin, I'd love to hear your comments
and feedback.

* DONE Multiple remotes with nullmailer                    :emacs:email:hack:

:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: multiple-remotes-with-nullmailer
:EXPORT_DESCRIPTION: Configuring nullmailer with multiple remote SMTP destinations
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER:
:END:

This a reference for future-me, and possibly someone pulling off an all-nighter
trying to get =nullmailer= to use the correct "remote".

** What is nullmailer and why use it?

[[https://github.com/bruceg/nullmailer][Nullmailer]] is a simple mail transfer agent that can forward mail to a remote
mail server (or a bunch of them).

I use Emacs to send email, and it can be configured to talk to a remote SMTP
server to send email. But, this blocks Emacs until the email is sent and the
connection closed. This is annoying, and having =nullmailer= installed locally
basically lets Emacs delegate this job without blocking.

** Why multiple remotes?

I have multiple email accounts, and I'd like to use the correct remote server
for sending email based on the FROM address.

I expected =nullmailer= to have some configuration to be able to specify this.
But, it turns out that =nullmailer= just forwards the email to all the
configured remotes [[https://github.com/bruceg/nullmailer/blob/master/src/send.cc#L382-L410][until one of them succeeds]].

** How do we, then, send email from the correct remote SMTP server?

Currently, I have two remotes - my personal domain (=@muse-amuse.in=) and GMail.

Having GMail as the first remote in =nullmailer='s configuration wouldn't let me
send emails from my personal domain. GMail seems to agree to send the email
coming from =@muse-amuse.in=, but overwrite the MAIL FROM address and change it
to my GMail address.

So, =@muse-amuse.in= has to be the first remote. But, this server also seemed to
accept and send emails with a =@gmail.com= =FROM= address. This was causing
emails sent from my GMail ID to go into spam, as expected.

I had to reconfigure this mail server to reject relaying mails that didn't
belong to the correct domain names -- i.e., reject relaying emails which had
=@gmail.com= in the =FROM= address.

~smtpd_sender_restrictions~ had to modified to have ~reject_sender_login_reject~
along with other values, and the ~smtpd_sender_login_maps~ had to be set to
allow only the =@muse-amuse.in= domain. [[https://serverfault.com/questions/318334/how-to-enforce-sender-address-to-be-logged-in-userexample-org-in-postfix][This serverfault answer]] explains this in

[[file:~/software/my-repos/muse-amuse.in/static/images/baralachala.jpg]]

#+TOC: headlines 1

** So, you cycled from Manali to Leh?

Well, Not really. We cycled from [[https://ridewithgps.com/routes/26328981][Kalath to Whiskey Nala]] -- a distance of 280km
-- which is about 60% of the Manali-Leh route.

** Who is "we"?

[[https://www.strava.com/athletes/24792932][Vivek]] and I were on the bikes. [[https://www.facebook.com/people/Hemant-Sharma/100002458775314][Shabu]] was our guide helping us fix our bikes and
fixing up our meals, but more than anything else, ensuring that we don't freeze
to death. Susheel was driving along and cheering us.

** How did you decide to do this?

Vivek and I were going to Coorg with [[https://www.instagram.com/pratikshasunder/][Prats]] and [[https://www.instagram.com/adarsh_makam/][Addy]], and Prats told us a whole
lot of stories of her adventures in the mountains. Not sure how bicycles came
into the picture, but as soon as they did, both of us got really excited about
it. This was on some sort of a bucket list for me, ever since I read [[https://www.vatsap.com/2009/10/09/bicycle-diary-4-the-bus-to-manali/][Vatsap's
cycling story]] many years ago. Soon, after we were back in town, the ball was set
rolling...

** What is the maximum elevation you cycled to?

We started off at around 1.8km and went up to about 5km in a span of 5 days. We
also spent a day in Manali, getting our cycles fixed and acclimatizing. You can
see the elevation profile [[https://ridewithgps.com/routes/26328981][here]].

** How long did the whole ride take?

Our plan was to finish the whole distance in 7 days. We couldn't get to our
designated camp on the 5th day, and had to use the support car to get to camp
before it got dark. We decided to end the ride once we took our bikes off the
road.

** Was it really hard? Why couldn't you finish the ride?

We expected the primary challenges to be:
- the altitude and lack of oxygen
- the fatigue from riding day after day after day...

But, cold played a much bigger role than we thought it would. As we got higher
and higher, it got so cold that we spent a significant amount of energy and
brain cycles on trying to fight the cold, rather than enjoying the views or
pushing ourselves to keep going despite the non-cold-related discomfort.

** So, you do really need a support vehicle?

Not really, if you were riding in better weather or were better prepared. The
Manali to Leh route usually has a lot of temporary shops setup during the
season, where you could crash, if it was too cold to just crash in your tent.
Since, we were going after the season had almost ended, many of these shops were
no longer open, and having the support car turned out to be quite useful on the
last day.

** How much did the support vehicle cost you?

It turned out to be quite an expense for something we originally didn't have in
mind. We spent about 20k on the vehicle, fuel and the driver's fee. We also paid
our guide + cook + bicycle expert, separately.

** Did you carry your own bikes?

Yes.

1. Flew from Bengaluru to Delhi
2. Took a bus from Delhi to Manali
3. Carried the bikes on the support car from Whiskey Nala to Leh
4. Flew back from Leh to Delhi

** Did the flights charge you for the bikes?

The carrier (IndiGo) from BLR to DEL charged us a handling fees of Rs. 1000. The
carrier (Vistara) on the return journey didn't.

** Would you recommend me to carry my bike?

You could find bikes on rent, both in Manali and Leh, for about 500 to 700 per
day. It would cost about 5-7k, based on how you plan your ride, to rent a bike.
You'll have to make arrangements to get the bike returned back to the place you
rent it from -- this can get a little tricky.

If you already own a bike, and can it packed in a proper box, I would highly
recommend that. The derailleurs, the shifters, and other such moving parts need
to be well packed and guarded. Use a box or a cycling bag to put it in. Get
professional help from a cycle retailer nearby, if required. This is one thing
you cannot take any chances on, or your whole trip may be jeopardized!

We hadn't paid enough attention to packing our bikes, and one of our bikes took
quite some beating on the way to Delhi. On the way back, we managed to get the
bike packed in a box and it was a breeze.

** What cycle spares/tools did you carry?

We were sort of ill prepared in this department. We only had the following:

- Hand pump
- Puncture kit
- Spare tubes (2 nos.)
- Allen key set

Based on advice from Shabu, I think you should also take these things:

- Brake cables
- Gear cables
- Spare tyre (1 Nos.)
- Brake shoes/pads
- Few spokes
- Chain oil

** What sort of preparation did you do for this ride?

We did a handful of 50-100km rides on weekends before this one. The only real
elevation training/trial that we did was the [[https://www.strava.com/activities/1211612521][Kalhatti climb]], one weekend before
this ride. This turned out to be pretty useful, and we found all the other
climbs during this ride much less steeper than some of the Kalhatti ones.

** Can you share your ride plan?

** What was a typical day during the trip, like?
- Wake up between 7 and 8, depending on when you can see/feel the warm sun. Laze
  in bed if you woke up too early, and the sun hasn't yet warmed the place up.
- Eat porridge, and a few slices of bread with peanut butter.
- Pack ourselves up in as many layers of clothing as we can, while still being
  able to pedal.
- Check the bikes for any loose/fallen-off/broken parts, blow, etc.
- Start pedaling away - usually between 9 and 10. It's too cold to start
  earlier. Keep adjusting the clothing, based on how cold/warm it is, and the
  wind chill.
- Keep munching, or sipping on some water (plain or mixed with some energizer).
- Continue pedaling, and start looking at the milestones a little more
  carefully. Lunch is on our mind, already.
- Lunch at around 1:30pm - usually, a couple of boiled eggs, and a potato. May
  be a chocolate, and some Frooti.
- More pedaling. The kilometers start getting harder, the chill is getting
  harsher.
- Huff and puff, and reach our camp for the day. Hi-fives! We'd try and reach
  the camp while there is still some sunlight there to keep us warm.
- Stretch it out, and switch into dry, warm clothes.
- Grab a quick snack - whole packets of biscuits would just disappear, alongside some tea.
- Talk, walk around, ponder about life, think about the day that's been, think
  about the day that is to come, and all that jazz.
- Eat dinner - dal and rice, mostly.
- Sleep like logs. Unless, there's a rat in the room that's attacking our dry
  fruits.

** What was the most enjoyable part of the ride?

- I really enjoyed sitting at Deepak Tal, and just looking at the clear water
- The climb to Baralacha La was the most challenging part of the ride. We could
  see that the weather was really bad in all the peaks around us, and it was
  getting really cold. Briefly, it was even snowing very lightly and we could
  see tiny snow flakes floating in front of us.
- The feeling of reaching the top of passes was quite thrilling, for both
  Rohtang and Baralacha La. Nakee La, not so much, since we still had about 30km
  ahead of us to finish the day.
- It was humbling to see all the BRO folks working to keep the roads open and
  functional! A big salute to them!
- Each time we had a truck or some bikers pass by, we would wave at them or show
  thumbs up, and it would give us some additional energy to keep pushing ahead.
- The tree covered road in Sissu was just mind blowingly beautiful, with all the
  trees golden and yellow, preparing for the fall.
- It was also nice to turn 30, in the hills. Vivek tried to make it as special,
  for me, as he could.

** What was the most challenging part of the ride?

The cold. (See, the [[/blog/cycling-from-manali-to-leh-an-faq/#was-it-really-hard-why-couldn-t-you-finish-the-ride][answer]] on why we didn't finish the ride).

** You keep saying it was cold, how cold was it really?

On the night we camped at Sarchu, the water in our bottles and unwashed cups had
frozen. We had gone to [[https://www.accuweather.com/en/in/darcha-dangma/3323751/october-weather/3323751][sub zero temperatures]] on many nights, it looks like. The
winds during the day were quite chilly, and got worse as we gained altitude.

** Did you meet any interesting people en-route?

- We met a guy from Slovenia who has been taking a couple or so months off for
  the past 10 years. He was riding around with a 55kg weighing bike for the past
  3 weeks, and was going from Leh to Manali, when we met him. He had a lot of
  stories to tell -- including recommending that we go cycling in Iceland, and
  enjoy watching the Northern lights from hot water baths.

- Shabu himself had a lot of stories to tell about all the people he had taken
  on this ride - from guys with a $6k bike to a 70 year old doing the route his
  4th time to the guy who would eat only olive oil mixed in rice to safeguard
  his tummy, and more!

- All the aachos and aamas in the shops/guest houses/etc that we went to were
  really nice to us. Most of the folks in the shops were planning to leave in a
  few days after we had met them since it had gotten really cold.

- We had our camp-site at Marhi in the compound of a HP state guest house. The
  care taker walks up to us, while we are setting up the tent, and says, "Idhar
  kahi par bhi baithna mana hai, 10 hazaar ka fine lag jaayega. Udhar toilet
  bana hua hai", pointing to the public toilets in a distance, "paisa nahi
  lagega". We had a good laugh, and ended up wondering if it was Swach Bharat
  showing some effect.

We probably would've talked to a lot more people, and met a lot more interesting
people, if we were there in better weather and didn't have a support vehicle
taking care of us.  Next time!

** Would you do this again?

May be. We feel like we got a taste of the challenge of the ride, and the rest
of the route wouldn't be anymore challenging than what we already saw, if we did
it in better weather. But, the better weather would also mean more traffic and
noise on the road.

** If yes, which part of the year would you do it?

Late August to mid-September might be a better time. We'd also need to look out
for rains and land-slides, though.

** If not, what other routes would you try?

- Cycling around Europe sounds like a fun thing to try
- Rides in the western ghats and/or Kerala seem promising
- A Tour of Meghalaya was something a friend suggested
- Pushing that a little more, ride all the way to Singapore/Indonesia, starting
  at home

** Do you have any pictures that you can share?

I recently discovered the [[http://www.hindustantimes.com/interactives/][interactives]] by HindustanTimes, and thoroughly loved
some of them. It felt like a fresh breath of air amongst all the other Indian
data driven journalism that I have been coming across in the recent past.

The visualizations are a lot more interactive than some of the other Indian
publications. These remind me of NYT's interactives, which are amongst the best
you'd see, while more often than not exploring data in the Indian context. I
really like that they explore a variety of ways of doing these visualizations,
and don't just fit the data into one of the many standard options available in a
visualization library.

It feels like they are willing to take their time to do these visualizations,
and are willing to collect data from multiple sources, and combine multiple
datasets to tell a story. I also like the fact that the visualizations and the
articles are more open-ended, allowing users to interact with and explore the
data, rather than trying to come up with an article full of conclusions with a
click-baity title. The fact that one of the sections is called [[http://www.hindustantimes.com/interactives-just-for-fun][Just for Fun]]
speaks to me.

The data and the code used in most of these interactives is open and available
on [[https://github.com/HindustanTimesLabs/][GitHub]], which is nice!

On the whole, I think they are doing pretty good work, and I shall be on the
lookout for even better stuff from them. I'm sure I'll pick up a thing or two
from their work, in my projects. Hopefully, other teams doing similar work will
also learn from there and produce more good stuff for greedy readers like me.

[[file:~/tmp/prime-ministers-of-india.png]]

I have been working on a simple time-line showing the terms of Prime Ministers
of India. Currently, the time-line is not very useful and only shows the
duration of the term in the time0line, with some pictures, with the hover
tool-tip linking to a Wikipedia page.  The interactive version is [[https://punchagan.github.io/data-projects/india-pm/][here]].

A simple extension of this would be to add historical events of different types
over this time-line, with links to more information on these events. I'm not
entirely sure, where I'm going with this, though.

Any ideas and suggestions are more than welcome.

:END:

I wanted to try using a dialog box/pop-up window as a prompt to remind me to
periodically make journal entries.  I had the following requirements:

- Simple, light-weight dialog box that allows text of arbitrary length
- Ability to launch the dialog from the shell
- Ability to have some placeholder or template text, each time the dialog is shown
- Save the input text to a specific =org-mode= file
- Write as little code of my own, as possible, to do this

I had initially thought about using a tool like =zenity=, or write a simple
dialog box in Python using =Qt=, =wx= or even =tk=, and then yank the input text
at the desired location. This probably wouldn't have turned out to be too hard,
but getting things to look and work exactly the way I wanted would have required
more code than I was willing to write or maintain.

After avoiding doing this for a while, I finally realized that I could simply
use Emacs with a new frame with the appropriate dimensions, and with the correct
file/buffer open to the desired location. This would

- eliminate the need for me to write the UI myself
- eliminate the need to do text manipulation in code, to yank it at the right
  place, in the right form. By directly opening up the editor at the required
  location, the onus is on me (as a text inputting user) to put it in, the way I
  want it.
- additionally provide me the comfort of being able to write with the full power
  of Emacs - keybindings and all that jazz.
- let me leverage =elisp= to do essentially whatever I want with the buffer
  being displayed as the dialog box.

I ended up with a command that looks something like this

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  emacsclient -c -n\
              -F '((title . "Title") (left . (+ 550)) (top . (+ 400)) (width . 110) (height . 12))'\
              -e '(pc/open-journal-buffer)'
#+END_SRC

[[file:/images/emacs-frame.png]]

This worked pretty nicely, except for the fact that with gnome-shell, the pop-up
frame doesn't always appear raised. It often gets hidden in the Emacs windows
group, and the whole idea of the pop-up acting as a reminder goes for a toss!
But, thanks to [[https://askubuntu.com/a/288483][this Ask Ubuntu post]], I could fix this pretty easily.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  emacsclient -c -n\
              -F '((title . "Title") (left . (+ 550)) (top . (+ 400)) (width . 110) (height . 12))'\

:END:

I came across a couple of fun word clouds, and felt like generating a word cloud
for my blog content to get a sense of the major themes on my blog, over the
years.

With some [[https://github.com/punchagan/data-projects/blob/master/blog/process_data.py#L134][simple Python code]], I was able to parse the blog and get the word
frequency over the years. I then used a [[https://github.com/punchagan/data-projects/blob/master/blog/viz.js][modified version]] of [[http://bl.ocks.org/lorenzopub/820bec1dafa6a5cd11aa23c1268edcbf][this d3 example]] to
generate a word cloud.

Using all the words used in each year to generate the word-cloud, made it very
noisy. So, I switched to using only the top 50 words for each year.

[[file:/images/word-cloud-top.gif]]

The word cloud doesn't seem very useful or insightful, but was fun to generate.
Each year's cloud seems to have some words that gives me a sense of some major
events/themes for that year, though it may not be very apparent to anybody other
than me.

The years which have a lot of posts have clear winners, but the winning words
are quite generic. For example, 2007 has words like "life", "time", etc., as
winners. To try to get rid of the generic words in the word cloud, I tried a
quick and dirty =tf-idf= based word-cloud, but it didn't really seem to help.

[[file:/images/word-cloud-tfidf.gif]]

I might get back to this later, to try and improve the =tf=idf= word cloud.
There are also other problems, like code-blocks in posts contributing variable
names, urls contributing domain names, etc.

Also, a simple line chart of the usage of tags vs. year might give a better
sense of the themes in the blog by year, even though it may not look as fancy as
a word-cloud.

Inspired by [[https://www.axios.com/thirty-years-of-major-flooding-in-the-united-states-2479957846.html][this post]] showing the major flooding events in the US, I created a
similar graphic for India. You can find an interactive version [[https://punchagan.github.io/data-projects/30-years-floods/][here]] -- hovering
over each flooding, shows some more information about the event.

- The graphic uses flooding related data from the [[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~floods/Archives/index.html][Dartmouth Flood Observatory]]
- The data for 2017 events is not up-to date.
- It is very likely that there is some missing data, and some inaccuracies in
  the data. 1987, for instance, doesn't show the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_Bihar_flood][Bihar flood]].
- The flood severity is indicated by the color of each shape
- Each shape represents the [[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~floods/Archives/ArchiveNotes.html][geographic flood extents]] - based on information
  obtained from news sources.
- The data for India map shape is obtained from this [[https://github.com/deldersveld/topojson/tree/master/countries/india][topojson collection]]

It is interesting to look at the severity definitions [[http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/Archives/ArchiveNotes.html][here]] -- the extreme class
floods, for instance, are defined to be those that have an estimated recurrence
interval of over 100 years. In a span of 30 odd years, there are a whole bunch
of regions which have been affected by extreme floods. Yet another case in point
showing that the climate change shit has really hit the roof!

** Code

I used =ogr2ogr= to convert the shape file obtained from the Dartmouth Flood
Observatory

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ogr2ogr -f geoJSON data/floods.json FloodArchive_region.shp
#+END_SRC

This file turned out to be about 6MB. I created a file with only Indian floods
by parsing the json file.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :dir ~/software/my-repos/data-projects/30-years-floods/data/ :exports code
  import json

  with open('floods.json', encoding='latin-1') as f:
      data = json.load(f)

  india_features = [

      if feature['properties']['COUNTRY'] == 'India'
  ]
  data['features'] = india_features

  # FIX some names in the data
  NAME_FIXES = [
      ('Tropical Storm K', 'Tropical Storm Komen'),
      ('Tropical Storm Hudhug', 'Tropical Storm Hudhud'),
  ]
  for feature in india_features:
      for name, fix in NAME_FIXES:
          cause = feature['properties']['MAINCAUSE']
          if name in cause:
              feature['properties']['MAINCAUSE'] = cause.replace(name, fix)

  with open('india-floods.json', 'w', encoding='latin-1') as f:
      json.dump(data, f)

I haven't written anything here for almost a year. I needed to break the
silence. So, here we go with a not-so-useful post showing how frequently I have
been posting to this blog, to get a sense of how long this break has been in
comparison to other silences in the past.

Neither the code below, nor the plots are very insightful. But, I just hope this
will get me started on the path to blogging more regularly. See you around!

** Work-flow

I jumped onto the [[https://gohugo.io][hugo]] bandwagon too.

I was totally impressed by how fast it is, and have been meaning to try it out
for a while, but wasn't impressed with the built-in =org-mode= support it came
with. This changed when I finally came across the [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo][ox-hugo]] package that does a
wonderful job of exporting blog posts from an org file to hugo's markdown
format. I have contributed a couple of patches to it, to make it work better for
myself and hopefully for others too.

Also, for this post, I used =ob-ipython= with the [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2017/01/29/ob-ipython-and-inline-figures-in-org-mode/][enhancements from scimax]] and
it has really made the whole experience quite enjoyable.

Among other things, I think one of the reasons for those peaks in the second
half of 2010, was having a smooth work-flow. My current work-flow feels pretty
nice too, and I hope it'll reduce some of the friction in writing more posts.

Onwards!

TL;DR

1. Am I saying India doesn't have a caste problem?

   No, it's definitely a HUGE problem!

2. Are these articles on Google Trends and Sindhu's caste useful at all?

   Just more click-baits and no useful contribution to the discussion on caste.

-----

First of all, congratulations to PV Sindhu on making it to the finals and
giving the world number one a hard fight!

This post, though, is not a celebratory one.  I read [[http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/while-pv-sindhu-fought-hard-medal-many-indians-googled-her-caste-48545][this article]] -- While PV
Sindhu fought hard for a medal, many Indians googled her caste -- by the News
Minute thanks to a [[https://twitter.com/tmkrishna/status/766844023810117632][re-tweet by TM Krishna]].  I probably wouldn't have paid much
attention to it, if not for the retweet by TMK.

Caste is a huge problem for the country, and if you still like to pretend it
isn't -- read [[http://www.firstpost.com/india/from-gujarat-to-gurugram-atrocities-on-dalits-rise-even-as-their-protests-continue-2960548.html][this]] for a start.  I'm not surprised that *some* people searched
for Sindhu's caste while she was battling it out at Rio.  But, *some* people
also searched for Badminton rules, and others for Sania Mirza!  What surprises
me is that the article doesn't try to put the data in a context at all.  Nor do
I understand the contribution this article makes to the discussion on caste.

https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8541/28818616900_d8e2b33cb0_b.jpg

I played around a little more with these search terms and Google Trends, and
here are a few things that I thought were worth sharing.

** Indian trends

First of all, the article says "Many Indians", and gives off cumulative
month-wise numbers (*UPDATE [2016-08-21 Sun 12:15]*: which are so wrong! See
Sankrant Sanu's [[http://indiafacts.org/lie-graphs-newsminute/][excellent article]] on India Facts).  But, what does it really
mean?

I don't know if anybody actually wrote about how many people actually followed
the match, but Sindhu actually managed to get a whole lot of people interested!

https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8014/29105184025_777ac4e5d0_b.jpg

More people searched for PV Sindhu than the daily average number of searches
(not hits) for Facebook and very close to the daily number of searches for Porn
-- two of the biggest things Internet is allegedly used for.  Can you see the
red line at the bottom?  That is the number of people who actually searched for
Sindhu's caste -- a tiny blip.

Let's take a closer look.  Here's a plot of some of the other auto suggest
terms + badminton rules & courts compared to Sindhu's name.

https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8507/28818617070_9c9fdfeb12_b.jpg

Nothing other than badminton rules (which is at about 1% of max. searches) is
even visible, clearly.

So, these other terms (wiki & caste being auto-suggested ones) are nowhere near
the actual number of searches being made for PV Sindhu's name alone.

Let's get rid of the name graph to get a closer look at the other terms.

https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8191/29105184165_133734e300_b.jpg

- The maximum number of people searching for Sindhu's caste is at about a fifth
  of the maximum number of people searching for badminton rules.  Interpreting
  it is upto you.  But, I'm not surprised knowing how significant caste has
  been in our society.  Also, notice that searches for wiki and caste fall off
  more gradually than the searches for the rules which peak while the game is
  being played and watched.

- Unsurprisingly, a bulk of the searches appear to be coming from Andhra and
  Telangana. Notice that the other states are searching more for the rules or
  her wiki page.

https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8169/29105184295_f3e1448d10_b.jpg

- Do you notice that the red (caste), blue (wiki) and violet (images) lines
  following a similar trend, until the last few hours?  What do you think is
  happening there? It's the shitty click baits working!  Look at the trends from
  ~8:30AM to ~12:30AM below -- the red has spread to other states as well!

https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8049/29105184245_6e691d318d_b.jpg

- And this is how it looks by the evening (17:00-21:00).  Well done, folks!
  The click bait articles totally succeeded!

https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8144/29032147971_c9c3c13fdc_b.jpg

If you are wondering how much effect the auto suggestions are having in
suggesting people to try searching for caste, I don't think that is much
because wiki and images are the other auto-suggest terms, with no such surges
in the number of searches.

** Trends from the Telugu states

We could see that the two Telugu states were more worried about the caste, than
the rest of the country.  Let's see how abnormal they are.

https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8293/29105183935_5bc55c03b4_b.jpg

https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8395/28483785994_89f1c999e4_b.jpg

You can definitely see the red line more prominently.  In case of Andhra the
peak searches for caste are at about 5% of the name searches.  A statistically
significant difference from the rest of the country.

Let's zoom in at the auto-suggest terms alone.

https://c7.staticflickr.com/9/8317/28818617430_bca8ed9d1a_b.jpg

https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8265/29105184115_a0a8e34f4b_b.jpg

Woah, Andhra is definitely quite an aberration from the rest of the country.
From about 1/5th of the maximum number of searches for rules, the maximum
number of caste searches jumps to about twice.  Telangana also is different,
but much less so.

Tamil Nadu's trends below for comparison.  You can't help noticing the last few
hours, can you?

https://c3.staticflickr.com/9/8426/28818617290_eb4b3a2535_b.jpg

*NOTE*: The trends and screen-shots for the states are slightly more recent
than the others.

** Conclusion

Without a context, I don't really see the point of these "news" articles.  It
seems more click-bait-y than useful to me.

If you still feel *many* Indians were searching for Sindhu's caste, while she
was fighting it out, go ahead and play with Google trends [[https://www.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%25207-d&geo=IN&q=pv%2520sindhu,pv%2520sindhu%2520caste,porn,movies][here]].  Add/remove
terms, change the time and location filters.  Some terms that could be
interesting to add to the comparison are: Kashmir, Independence day, Facebook.

Later, I looked at the search results and then found that this article wasn't
the only one like it.  I didn't bother to read the others, but I really hope at
least some of them are talking sense.  Is any of them really trying to
contribute to the discussion on caste, meaningfully?

Also, the actual search results don't seem to give useful answers to the folks
so curious about Sindhu's caste.  I hope none of these articles are trying to
help them out.

Finally, if you are using Google Trends to write an article, [[https://medium.com/@dannypage/stop-using-google-trends-a5014dd32588#.js332qw0h][Danny Page has
some really good advice]].

I was trying to play around with Nikola's code today and learnt about a
documented weirdness of Python's reload.

- Below are two versions of code -- =ORIGINAL= and =UPDATED= respectively
  referring to the orginial code and the code after changes. The code only has a
  =PLUGINS= list, which is changed in each version of the code.

  #+BEGIN_SRC python :exports both :results output
    # Work in a temporary directory
    import os
    import tempfile
    os.chdir(tempfile.mkdtemp())

    # Module content, original and updated
    ORIGINAL = "# PLUGINS = []"
    UPDATED = "PLUGINS = ['rss']"

    def create_conf_file(content):
        """Create a conf.py module with given content."""
        with open('conf.py', 'w') as f:
            f.write(content)
  #+END_SRC

- =conf= doesn't have a =PLUGINS= attribute in the =ORIGINAL= code.  It's been commented out!

  #+BEGIN_SRC python :exports both  :results output
    create_conf_file(ORIGINAL)
    import conf
    # PLUGINS is not defined in the module, originally.
    print(conf.PLUGINS)
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  : AttributeError: module 'conf' has no attribute 'PLUGINS'

- The code for =conf= has been updated, but the module doesn't yet have a
  =PLUGINS= attribute, since the new module isn't imported until we reload.

  #+BEGIN_SRC python :exports both  :results output
    create_conf_file(UPDATED)
    import conf
    print(conf.PLUGINS)
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  : AttributeError: module 'conf' has no attribute 'PLUGINS'

- =PLUGINS= has the expected value, after the reload

  #+BEGIN_SRC python :exports both  :results output
    import importlib
    importlib.reload(conf)
    print(conf.PLUGINS)
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  : ['rss']

- What happens when we revert to the =ORIGINAL= code, and reload the module?

  #+BEGIN_SRC python :exports both  :results output
    # We write back the original file. PLUGINS should be empty!
    create_conf_file(ORIGINAL)
    import conf
    importlib.reload(conf)
    print(conf.PLUGINS, "<---Whaaaat!")
  #+END_SRC

  #+RESULTS:
  : ['rss'] <---Whaaaat!

The behavior is well documented, along with a reasoning of why it is the way it
is, but you can trip over it if you don't know. I hit a bug and was wondering
if there was a race condition somewhere, until I read the docs for [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reload][reload]]. On
reload, *the module dict is updated*, instead of creating a new dict. Any
values *not redefined* in the new code for the module *remain unchanged*.

I sometimes hang out on [[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%2523org-mode][#org-mode]] or [[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%2523nikola][#nikola]] and answer questions. I usually am
not able to answer off the top of my head and I look up docs or dig through the
code.  Sometimes, we find ready-made documented answers, but other times we end
up contributing some documentation, filing an issue, submitting a patch or
hacking up something for that super-special use-case.

Until now, I looked at this time as IRC time, which loosely translates to
distraction time.  But, I'm usually learning about the tools I use a little bit
more. Even when I'm not, I'm helping someone do something they want to do.
Sometimes empowering them to fix future problems on their own.  And indirectly
making the user community a wee-bit happier, and possibly the software a tiny
bit better.

This isn't limited just to helping someone on IRC.  Helping out a co-worker do
something that they are new to, or just adding a comment or editing a
Stack-overflow answer may end up in the "distraction time" bin, just because
you weren't doing something on your TODO list.  It needn't be.

Taking cue from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(football)][scorers in Football]], I decided to call this time *assist time*
and to try to start seeing this time as (semi-)productive. Naming helps.

That dense book you want to read but has been lying on your desk while you
procrastinate on twitter. You know you'll have to tune everything else out,
and read slowly, word by word, trying to understand and make sense.

That vague blog post idea swirling in your head while you look at cat pictures,
one after another. Distilling your thoughts and putting them down for general
consumption is a lot of thinking and effort away.

That =${cool_programming_thing}= that a talk got you excited about so long ago.
But, watching talks and intending to start using it is all you do about it. You
know its going to take a fair amount of reading, thinking and time, before you
can really use it well.

Like all those squats and lifts you dread, these things are building your

Some sites that I like a lot for their content, have zero styling on them.
I find it pretty hard to read when the lines are long and I have to read all

I had a simple bookmarklet until now that just changed the width of the page.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].setAttribute('style', 'width: 600px')
#+END_SRC

[[https://twitter.com/kamalx][Kamal]] shared with me [[http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com][a recommendation]] for 7 simple styling rules that will make
pages easier to read. I liked them, and modified my bookmarklet to use these
rules now.

Drag and drop the link below onto your bookmarks bar if you want to use it.

The code in a readable format is below.

I had posted a link to an poem written on Medium on a Slack channel that I use
with friends.  A friend said that she liked the fact that the Slack article
preview had the reading time from Medium in it.  She could decide whether or
not she wanted to read the poem or any other article at that moment.

This gave me the idea for a reading time extension for my [[https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium][browser]], or my [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][feed
reader]] or my [[https://pinboard.in][bookmarks]] -- my reading list.  The first version should be able to
compute or extract the reading time for an article or a tab in my browser, and
index them.  I want to be able to specify the amount of time I will be able to
spend reading, and be presented with something from my reading list.  I think
this would help with scheduling the reading of longer articles, and also to
actually help me get through my reading list.

Reading time estimates that use heuristics based on word-count may not really
work, and may do [[https://medium.com/@fchimero/this-should-only-take-a-minute-or-four-probably-e38bb7bf2adf#.mvkd09m6m][more harm than good]].  But, it may still be worth a try to see
if it helps my reading habits in any way.  A quick search pointed me to [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readism-article-reading-t/bmiolhceebkeljaikojgcoeefblcihje][this

In the past few weeks, I noticed three instances where I was forced to take a
break exactly when I was ready to jump in and write some code to fix a bug or
add a small feature.  I had to step out of the house and take a walk to meet
someone, etc.

I ended up getting ideas during the walks, which significantly changed and
simplified how I would've implemented things, if not for those breaks.  Even if
I did end up zeroing down to those solutions, I am pretty sure it would've
taken a couple of not-so-good attempts and much longer than it did.

Context switches are usually considered to be [[http://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/][expensive for programmers]], but
taking a break at the exact time when I had all the required context loaded
into my head seemed to help. It was also probably helpful that I was taking a
walk, and there wasn't really any other inputs or outputs competing for the
space in my head.

This got me thinking about doing this more deliberately -- I'd love to hear
about any experiences or any experiments any of you have done with this.  Also,
I'm reminded of Rich Hickey's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc][Hammock Driven Development]] talk and I wonder if
this is a smaller/different version of it, and makes me want to try out the
things he suggests more deliberately.  If any of you has thoughts and
suggestions, I'd love to hear from you!

CFP for PyCon 2016 is [[https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2016/proposals/][open]] and you should propose a talk!

There has been a lot of discussion on trying to improve the talk quality at the
events. As my bit of contribution to this, below is a re-hash of some good
advice from the internet on why you should give a talk, and how to submit a
good proposal.

** Why?

- You [[https://vimeo.com/96692937#t=2m56s][needn't be an expert]] on a topic. If you have enough experience about
  something to help make the next person's experience with it better, you are
  good.

- Its a great way to find people who are interested in the same things as you
  are and to get to talk to them.  If you are an introvert, you should
  [[https://emptysqua.re/blog/tech-talks-are-campfires-jesses-three-reasons-you-should-speak-at-pycon/#meet-specialists][definitely be speaking]]!

- Proposing and giving a talk is about thinking about something hard enough to
  refine your thoughts, and being able to explain it to others. Its a useful
  skill to hone.

** How?

- Talks are [[http://speaking.io/plan/talks-are-entertainment/][entertainment]]. Pick a topic that you are excited about and fascinated
  by. Let it be a general topic that will have a significant number of people
  interested in it.

- What you want the attendees to be telling their friends about your talk,
  after they go back.  Make it the [[http://blog.briancurtin.com/posts/writing-a-pycon-proposal.html][objective]] of your talk.

- Submit a complete, clear and compelling proposal. Show the reviewers that you
  are willing to put in the effort to prepare for and to give a great
  talk. Here are a [[https://github.com/akaptur/pycon-proposals/tree/master/accepted][bunch of proposals]] to see and learn from.

- Submit an outline along with your talk. Show the talk can be delivered in the
  given time and will be interesting. Include an indication of how much [[https://github.com/akaptur/pycon-proposals/blob/master/accepted/important_decisions_kaptur_2014.md#outline][time]]
  you intend to spend on each part of your talk.

- Choose a good title.  The title is what catches the attention of your
  audience when they are trying to pick a talk.  Avoid buzz words.

- Get feedback. Like any writing, feedback can be helpful at all stages --
  brainstorm while choosing topics to getting critique on the full abstract.

- Convince the reviewers that you can give a [[https://emptysqua.re/blog/seven-tips-for-pycon/#note-to-the-organizers][well-rehearsed and entertaining]] --
  link to previous talks you've given, include links to any testimonials you've
  received from your audience, etc.  If you don't have a previously recorded
  talk, give a small talk to your friends or colleagues and have it recorded.

** References

- PyCon US has some [[https://us.pycon.org/2016/speaking/talks/][good advice]] on how to submit a proposal and most of it is
  generic enough for you to use for PyCon India, or any other conference.

- These posts ([[https://emptysqua.re/blog/tech-talks-are-campfires-jesses-three-reasons-you-should-speak-at-pycon/][1]] [[https://emptysqua.re/blog/seven-tips-for-pycon/][2]] and [[https://emptysqua.re/blog/tag/conference-tips/][more]]) by Jesse Davis are so so good!

Even if you put aside questions about how a vetting process, for "dealing with"

Earlier this month, a researcher made a dataset containing the profiles of about
70,000 users public. He didn't really see a problem in doing this because he
felt he was only presenting [[https://twitter.com/KirkegaardEmil/status/730449904909324289][already publicly available]] data in a more usable
form. was only presenting it in a more usable form.

Yesterday, I came across this quote in the very first chapter of [[https://twitter.com/allendowney][Allen Downey]]'s
book [[http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/index.html][Think Stats]] which I liked a lot, and reminded me of this incident.

[[https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7193/26969166130_58e4865f47_b.jpg]]

I hadn't looked at the OKCupid data release and the discussion around it much,
but I went back and read [[https://points.datasociety.net/okcupid-data-release-fiasco-ba0388348cd#.u8xxlkqsv][this article]] by a social media researcher who thinks a
lot about these things.

She puts forth a lot of interesting ideas to think about ethics. Some things
that stood out to me are:

- Ask yourself how the person whose data you are using feels about the data.
- Taking a 'what if' impact approach to thinking about data and ethics.

Also, you needn't really call yourself a researcher to be actually doing
experiments with (or [[http://www.npr.org/2016/05/17/478266839/this-is-your-brain-on-uber][analyzing]]) "big-data" and discovering and putting out facts
that have an impact -- however big or small. You should really go read the
article, whether or not you are a researcher using data.

Incidentally, there is a meet-up on [[http://www.meetup.com/DataKind-Bangalore/events/231310093/][Data Ethics]] this weekend in Bangalore. I'm
excited to learn and think more about this, and talk to others who care.

Thanks to a [[https://twitter.com/baali_][friend]] I got an upgrade to our still-being-setup kitchen.  I now

use a bowl that people usually use to boil [[http://img6a.flixcart.com/image/pot-pan/t/s/8/aluminium-polish-top-jk-vallabhdas-400x400-imae7w9y9ehukjhx.jpeg][milk]] etc. for making whatever I did.
The non-stick pan feels so great!  It has made it a lot simpler to make some of
the things I used to, because its non-stick. And it has vastly expanded the
possibilities of things I can make, by virtue of being flat and wide based.
The pan is such a great addition to my kitchen paraphernalia, and it adds a new
dimension to the kind of things I can make.  I'm not here to write a user
review for it, though.

What are such tools in other things that you do, that drastically changed the
way you did something, or added a new dimension to the kinds of things you
could do, tools that make you feel like you have a new super-power?  Learning
to write Python (after starting off with C) seemed to give me so much power
allowing me to focus on the problem, rather than fussing over the low level
details. Sasha mentions in [[http://sasha.wtf/anki-post-1/][this post]] how using a Spaced Repetition System like
[[https://ankiweb.net/][Anki]] drastically improved her efficiency because she could focus on thinking
about higher level things rather than trying to recall or search for what
method or function to use to do something.

What are some such level-up tools for you? Is there a systematic approach to
discovering tools?

Another post about blogging.

[[https://github.com/CodeFalling/blog-admin][blog-admin]] now supports [[http://getnikola.com][Nikola]], thanks to yours truly. =blog-admin= is an Emacs
package by [[https://twitter.com/codefalling][CodeFalling]] that lets you view and manage your (static site
generated) blog from within inside Emacs.

Nikola's command line utility is pretty nifty and does a bunch of useful
things. I had a few utility functions to do common tasks like create new post
and deploy blog. This worked well, but moment I came across this =blog-admin='s
tabular view, I was sold!

[[https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog][org2blog]] (a blogging tool I used previously) had a tracking file that kept
track of all the posts I made, and I used it quite a bit for navigation --
thanks to =org-mode='s search functionality. The tabular view of =blog-admin=
is even better!  I really like the fact that the author has tried to keep the
package generic enough to support any blog, and adding support for Nikola has
been quite easy.

The filtering functionality is crude, but good enough for a start. One thing I
want to add is a preview functionality for drafts. Showing some (writing)
statistics would also be nice -- No. posts in the last month, total published
posts, etc.  No promises, but you may see some of these things, soon. :)

I use [[http://getnikola.com][Nikola]] for generating this blog. When creating a new post, it prompts for
a title, and creates a file for the post.

Often I'm starting off with only a vague idea that needs to be fleshed out
before it can be published (or discarded). It is quite difficult to come up
with a title at this stage. I just want to start a draft and write things down!

I could use a "draft-title" and change it after finishing a post, but this
feels tedious -- requires 3 steps -- change the title, post filename and post
slug.  The last two steps are optional, really, but I feel they are important
especially when the original title is very different from the new one.

Being forced to come up with a title before anything else, feels tedious and,
adds to the effort required to start off a new post.  I shouldn't really be
worrying about the effort required to change the title of an unwritten post,
but it happens subconsciously.

To work around this, I now have a "re-title utility" in my editor that takes
care of all the tedious details.  I can start with a random title, like
Draft-1, and change it when I'm done with the post.  I feel this is going to
lead to a lot more drafts, at the very least, if not published posts.

Another work-flow related thing I came across recently was @Malabarba's [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/1717#issue-150907043][issue]]
on CIDER (an IDE for Clojure in Emacs).  The [[http://www.braveclojure.com/getting-started/#Using_the_REPL][REPL]] takes a while to startup and
this caused him to not use CIDER for running tests, if there wasn't an already
open REPL.

The tedium that people feel effects how they use the tool.  Not surprisingly,
making tedious-feeling tasks a breeze with the tool also effects how and how
much they use it.  Subtle variations in a work-flow could make or break it.
How do you discover such potential work-flow make-or-break-ers? I think, these
things would help:

- Use the tool yourself (dog-food)
- Talk to (or watch!) people using your tool
- Look at work-flows in other similar tools
- Thinking explicitly about various scenarios and simplifying or improving
  work-flows

I'd love to hear examples of this, and any ideas or thoughts you may have on
identifying and fixing such things!

I was helping a friend of mine setup [[http://jajoosam.github.io][his blog]] and we were trying to use [[http://hexo.io][Hexo]] --
a static site generator.  We chose a Javascript based tool since he's trying to
learn Javascript.  I skimmed through active Javascript projects in [[https://staticsitegenerators.net][this list]]
and finally zeroed down upon Hexo based on its popularity.  I promised to help
my friend to set this up, but he first tried to do it on his own and got back
to me after an hour or so, quite frustrated and almost on the verge of giving
up setting it up.  I didn't expect this from a tool that had so many stars,
forks, plugins and so much active development.

We finally got it working, but we found that the error messages were horrendous
-- even for someone who has been using free and open-source tools for a while
now.  Printing out errors from compiler or interpreter directly along with the
stack trace is almost always the worst thing to do for a tool/utility (as
opposed to an API or library).  The stack trace is definitely useful, for
developers trying to build upon or improve your tool.  Have a debug or
development mode where developers can get all the information they need.

If you care about your users, especially new users, make sure you spend
sufficient time on showing human-readable messages. If possible list the
possible causes for every error along with tips for troubleshooting.

It was the final day and after about 5 hours of descent through the hills on the
road, we had stopped for lunch about 100km from Haridwar. Of the 14 people who
stayed until the last day, 5 of us were in a Sumo and 9 were in a Tempo
Traveller van. We had already said our goodbyes when we got into the vehicles,
but we happened to stop at the same place for lunch -- thanks to the drivers.
Daksh, a 10 year old who breezed through his first trek, came running to us from
the van and hugged Arvind who had just finished his second back to back trek
and has plans for 2 more next month. Both of them were beaming happiness. This
pretty much sums up the past 5 days in the trek! The rest of the trip was just
descending further and getting into civilization, reminiscing all the fun,
catching up with civilization and slipping back into the bustle and the noise of
normal life, with more goodbyes.

I had been travelling for about 2 weeks before the trek, crawling up slowly from
Bangalore to Delhi, and then spent a couple of days in Mukteshwar after reading
about it somewhere on the internet. I enjoyed the calm of the hills, and the
warmth of a family with who I happened to stay with. But, I wasn't done. I
really wanted to see the beautiful night sky filled with stars, and gaze into
the distance at snow capped mountains and be overwhelmed by their grandness. I
knew I had to go further into the hills. I came back to Delhi, to get more
winter/cold wear and to go back with a better plan. I mentioned to [[https://twitter.com/baali_][baali]] the
idea of heading off either to Kashmir or somewhere in the north-east by myself
using public transport and local help, or going on a trek with a group. He
recommended India Hikes, and helped me find a trek that fit my requirements --

1) starts as soon as possible, but isn't too long -- I had to be back in
   Bangalore in a week.
2) had opportunities to enjoy -- great views of the snow capped mountains and
   the night sky.
3) not too hard -- I didn't want to spend all my time thinking about where and
   how I was going to put my next step. I wanted a relaxed trek with time to
   look around and take in the beauty.

There were only a couple of treks that seemed to fit the bill. baali pushed me
and got me registered for the [[http://indiahikes.in/deoria-tal-chandrashila-peak-trek/][Deoriatal-Chandrashila trek]]. I got my "trek
uniform" from Decathlon and packed my bags for the trek -- I only had a couple
of days to do this. I was sorta nervous about all this because I really dislike
cold weather, but baali gave me loads of moral support to take the first steps.

This post is an attempt to record this trek for my future self. If you'd like
detailed documentation for the trek, see [[http://indiahikes.in/deoria-tal-chandrashila-peak-trek/#trek-details][India Hikes' documentation]].

** The Base-camp

I reached Haridwar in a bus from Delhi, way before the scheduled time to meet
everyone else. I walked around the town before sunrise, reached the station and
waited for trekkers to start trickling in. The base camp, Sari, was about an 8
hour ride from Haridwar, that I spent mostly sleeping -- it was quite hot! Much
hotter than I expected. And I started to feel comfortable about possibly not
having enough clothing for the cold. When packing, baali and I were trying to
make a sensible trade-off between the amount of stuff I carried and not feeling
uncomfortably cold. He had the experience of one-trek and was leaning towards
the lighter-backpack side, and this being my first trek I wanted to be heavily
on the extra-clothing-for-cold side. The final state of my backpack left behind
a slight worry in the back of my mind, which kept coming to the fore from time
to time, until the bus ride.

#+HTML: <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/punchagan/26628444206/in/album-72157667426705882/" title="Sari village school"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1446/26628444206_bf6a964c3d_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Sari village school"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The base camp turned out to be a small lodge sort of a thing with cozy rooms for
the trekkers and India Hikes trek leads, guides and other support staff. The
views from here weren't very different than what I could see from Mukteshwar.
There weren't really any snow peaks in our view and there was a lot of lush
green and the Sari village in view. We were received by similing faces of the
support staff and trek leads, welcoming us on the trek. The comforting
camaraderie would be a feature throughout the rest of the trek! Our group had
some people who had done treks with India Hikes before, and all the interactions
around me were giving me a good feeling of joining a great community. Everyone
other than me seemed to know everyone else, yet new people were made to feel
comfortable and I felt totally at home.

#+HTML: <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/punchagan/26628447826/in/album-72157667426705882/" title="Tracing the track on a map"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1654/26628447826_cda76911cd_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Tracing the track on a map"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Kamal, our trek lead, briefed us about the trek and wished us good luck for the
trek. The thing I loved the most about the briefing was our guide Dhan Singh
explaining to us that India Hikes aims to make high altitude trekking more
generally accessible and that we should treat this trek as a learning
experience to be able to go on treks by ourselves with friends and/or family!
It was going to be 4 days of learning about all sorts of things from symptoms
of AMS and the horrors of it to using micro spikes and different walking styles
on snow & ice!  It was also the beginning of 4 days of listening to so many
stories of various different treks, especially [[http://roopkund.com/][Roopkund]].

** Deoriatal

After some lovely breakfast, we packed and set out for what was going to be a
short hike up, to Deoria tal -- lake created by the Gods. Beautiful meadows, a
lake and glorious views of the snow-capped mountains in the backdrop. Picture
perfect! This was exactly the kind of thing I was looking for, I thought, when I
ended up at Mukteshwar! This was just what I wanted from the trek. Apart from
the gorgeous night skies.

This was the best part of the trek, for me. Even more than the summit.

#+HTML: <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/punchagan/26655256465" title="Deoriatal"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1450/26655256465_226234594b_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Deoriatal"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The rest of the day was spent walking around the camp-site, and taking in as
much of the beauty as we could.  We walked up to a couple of view points that
gave better views of the mountains and walked around the lake, enjoying the
calmness.  We could see Chandrashila, the peak we were going to summit in 3
days from the second view point.  Also, the Rhododendron covered slopes were a
sight to watch!

#+HTML: <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/punchagan/26655262305/in/album-72157667426705882/" title="Chandrashila from Deoriatal Campsite"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1699/26655262305_4ca2847f1d_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Chandrashila from Deoriatal Campsite"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Playing Frisbee with the trekkers and cricket with cooks and other support
staff taking care of people at the camp, along with the trek lead and guides
added more physical activity that I enjoyed quite a bit.  The sport, apart from
getting to hang around with people and getting to know them, also helped me
keep myself warm, through out the day, without too much clothing.

The camp site had a few other camps, some of whom we interacted with and others
who we didn't talk to but were spotted near all of the rest of the camps we
were going to have in the next 3 days.

#+HTML: <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/punchagan/26381830740/in/album-72157667426705882/" title="Selfie-Sai at Deoriatal"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1649/26381830740_a248322e63_z.jpg" width="427" height="640" alt="Selfie-Sai at Deoriatal"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We had some story telling, singing and oxy-meter readings in the dining tent
before yet another yummy meal. My oxygen levels were good, but my pulse was
close to 90. It had come back down to 60 during the next couple of days. I
wonder if my body was still acclimatising or if it was signs of some of the
anxiousness that was going to hit me later in the night.  I went back to sleep
after fooling around with the other post dinner, till about 10 o' clock.  I
fell asleep quickly, but I started feeling extremely anxious and uneasy, to the
point of me even thinking of hiking back down to the base camp. I'm still not
sure what it was that made me so uneasy, and thankfully I didn't have the
feeling again during the rest of the trek.  I was able to ease back into sleep
with some reading.

I would definitely think of Deoria Tal, whenever I felt the need for a calm
amidst some awe-inspiring beauty, without trekking too much.

** Tala or Rohini Bugyal

We woke up to a clear sky and a serene lake that drew me to go and sit by its
side, until breakfast. We got packed up and prepared for what was going to be
the longest day, in terms of the time spent hiking and distance covered. The
hike was going to be through a forest trail, with lots of Rhododendron trees and
dozens of different bird species. This stretch of the trek also had some of the
views I liked the most.

The hike was relaxed and we had our packed lunches after about half way through
the trek. The lunch, like all other meals, was so yummy that I regretted
carrying such a small box. Ankit, Abhirut and Shyamlee with bigger boxes,
kindly shared some of their food with me.

#+HTML: <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/punchagan/26561994202/in/album-72157667426705882/" title="Lunch break on the ridge"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1508/26561994202_f6f236a023_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Lunch break on the ridge"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Near the end of the hike we bumped into Tanmoy -- another Trek lead with India
hikes who was going to meet us at our next night's base camp. He was mapping
the trek route and had covered our 3 day trail in a single day. The next night
at Martoli he would tell us his story of how he got into trekking and inspire
us with them!

The evening was a musical one. After our daily dose of Himalayan stories, it was
great to hear trek lead Kamal, sing some popular numbers with so much feeling.
Pooja and Meenakshi followed up with a deluge of songs before and during a fun
filled Antakshari session. Sai, Padmini and Sarita sang some old numbers, some
of which seemed like "home-productions" to the opposite team.

#+HTML: <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/punchagan/26589808721/in/album-72157667426705882/" title="Tali camp site"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1610/26589808721_49b97ec31e_z.jpg" width="640" height="427" alt="Tali camp site"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

** Martoli

We woke up to some rain and cloudy weather. We delayed the start a little bit,
to make the trek more comfortable, since it was going to be a short trek
anyway.  The skies cleared up pretty quickly and we hiked up to Martoli through
a maze of Rhododendron trees!

Bhrujgali was supposed to be our next camp-site but we camped a little lower,
at Martoli, because it had a more accessible water source.  We did the same at
Rohini Bugyal, the previous day, camping at Tala instead of the usual spot.

The hike was a pretty simple one, that took about 4 hours. We stopped at a
refreshing stream on the way, where we had our lunch and took lots of photos!
The trail was a forest trail that seemed very similar to some of the trails
through the Sahyadris. One of the trekkers, Padmini, took a different trail at
a fork and we had a few anxious moments, looking around, for her. She had some
very anxious moments, but was really happy that she was brought back safely to
the group by Dhan Singh.  It may be useful for the trekkers to carry a whistle
to make it easier to seek attention in such cases, Sai mentioned.  I spent some
time during the rest of the hike walking with Padmini, chatting up and getting
know things about each others' lives.

I decided not to click any photographs and look around more. Also, not having
much power in the battery helped enforce this decision. Batteries drain pretty
quickly in such cold weather, and I learnt that keeping the batteries in your
sleeping bag can help prevent that. I wonder why people don't carry some kind
of solar chargers, instead of carrying so many spare batteries and power
banks. Also, it may be interesting to look for devices that convert some of the
energy spent hiking into usable power.

The evening was spent relaxing, talking and getting to hear more stories!  We
also had the company of the group who had gone to the summit on that day, and
were trying to help us with some tips from their newly gained experience! We
were taught how to use clamp-ons, micro spikes and gaiters, in case there is
snow or ice on the trail.

It was going to be a 4am start the next day, and almost everyone hit the sacks
immediately after an early dinner. Rajesh and I, though, were struck by the
beauty of the night sky. I tried my hand at some night sky photography and got
some okay-ish shots, including one which captured a shooting star.  A wide
angle lens and a tripod would've been extremely useful.

** Summit day

Activity started in the camp-site from as early as 2:30 am. Excitement was in
the air. Trek leads and guides were pushing hard to get people lined up as early
as possible, to avoid hiccups due to melting ice and snow in the trek. We
managed to get the whole group going by 4:15 am. It was going to be one of our
steepest climbs of the trek, to Bhrujgali, in the darkness. Owing to the
darkness, the two guides and the trek lead had to be helping people out, more
than usual. I ended up being the sweeper until it was dawn, with some company
from Abhirut, Ankit and Shyamlee. It was fun just screaming out to push people,
mentally. Much like cheering from the sidelines during a game of [[https://vimeo.com/114920914#t=7m13s][Ultimate]].

It was inspiring to see people pushing themselves hard, despite their physical
problems. Asthma, cramps, come what may, lets get to the top! I hiked up with
Padmini, who was probably the eldest trekker and was slowly but steadily making
her way up. It always helps to have someone talking to you, to distract you from
your [[http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/quieting-the-lizard-brain.html][lizard brain]]. She was quite happy that I walked with her all the way up.

The bird watchers amongst us, were delighted by how many Monals they spotted.
The view from the top was gorgeous. Many many dozens of photographs were taken,
in various poses, and various directions. It all looked so glorious that nobody
really wanted to stop. So many snow covered peaks, all around. Raju bhai, Dhanno
bhai and Kamal bhai had a lot of work to do, telling all of us the names of the
different peaks that we could see. But, not before the excitedly told the rest
of the India Hikers that everyone in the group had summit-ed. They were very
pleased by the fact that the whole group made it safely to the top!

#+HTML: <a data-flickr-embed="true"  href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/punchagan/26629332506/in/album-72157667426705882/" title="Reflecting atop Chandrashila"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1628/26629332506_9d9e40f284_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Reflecting atop Chandrashila"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

On some of the previous nights, I saw some folks use apps on their phones to
help them identify stars and constellations in the night sky. Nobody seemed to
have an app that helped identify the peaks. It would be interesting to find or
build something that does this.

The descent was much simpler and quite relaxed. 5 of the trekkers left early,
because they wanted to get to Haridwar for some more adventure and fun --
rafting and more bird/animal watching.

The weather suddenly turned bad. It got super cloudy and the wind got really
chilly, before there was hail and snow. Everyone got into their tents for the
afternoon, and this was practically the first afternoon I spent inside the tent.
Once we got out of the tents after a couple of hours, the landscape had totally
changed. Everything above about 50m from where we were was filled with snow, and
we experienced the coldest and harshest weather of the trek. It was the first
time, I felt I had got the balance of how much cold clothing I should be
carrying wrong. I had used up all the layers of clothing I had, and yet felt a
chill when I was not inside a tent. Next time around I'll definitely erring on
the side of carrying more. The weather didn't get any better until the next
morning.

We spent the evening in the dining tent, chatting away and playing Uno -- led by
Mitali, a 10 year old who also breezed through the trek along with Dhruv who was
also 10. We stuck together the whole evening to keep ourselves warm, and the
trek was officially called to an end with certificate distribution and everyone
sharing some of their thoughts about the trek.

** The end

I got back to Delhi with the others, from Haridwar and then to Bangalore. Its
nice to be back amongst friends and family and back in familiar places. But, the
silence of the mountains does haunt you for a while.

If I do go back up the mountains through a trekking group, you know who I'm
going to be going with! India Hikes did manage to give me that feeling of being
a part of wonderful community that is trying to make High Altitude trekking more
accessible by documenting various treks and arranging treks with excellent
support including some very delicious food.

I've always liked the idea of "leaving a place better than you found it". India
Hikes seems to really believe in this idea, and is trying really hard to
encourage trekkers to imbibe this value and help each other in this mission. I
really hope that there's at least a handful of people in each trek, who take
back this idea along with pleasant memories from the mountains.

On the whole the trek was an amazing experience. Gach yaara! I am definitely
looking forward to go on more treks. As much as I dislike harshly cold weather,
the beauty of the mountains is just too irresistible.

* DONE Partial postgres db dumps for a Django app :blag:django:postgres:sql:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: partial-postgres-db-dumps-for-a-django-app
:EXPORT_DATE: 2016-01-10T05:39:18+05:30
:END:


Off late, I have been working with a large =postgres= database that is used by
an app built in =Django=.  I wanted a partial dump of the database to try out
some experimental clean up scripts.  I haven't really used databases before,
and the last time I had to do this I did it in a pretty ad-hoc fashion.  This
time around, I tried to do it more methodically and to document it.

** The Django Route

I looked around for tools that let you do this, and found [[https://github.com/davedash/django-fixture-magic][django-fixture-magic]].
I first tried it out on my older partial dump (10% as large as the original db)
and it turned out to be reasonably fast and worked well, after making a [[https://github.com/davedash/django-fixture-magic/pull/35][few
changes]] to get it working with Python 3.x.  Its =kitchensink= flag to the
=dump_object= seemed like a promising option, but *didn't* really seem to get all
the required tables for ManyToManyFields.  I worked around it, by getting a
dump of all the models which were related using Django's =dumpdata=.

*** Get a dump with objects of interest

The =dump_object= command lets you run commands to select the objects that you
want to have in the dump, and that is quite a useful thing.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  python manage.py dump_object dataset.Product -k --query '{"subcategory_id__in": [1886, ...]}' > products.json
#+END_SRC

Also, get a dump of related tables.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # Dump of related fields
  python manage.py dumpdata dataset.Attribute > attributes.json
#+END_SRC

*** Create the new empty db

Next, create a new database where this fixture can be loaded!

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Create the db
sudo su - postgres
createdb mydb

# Create a user, if required
createuser -P

#+END_SRC

**** Grant access to the user

In the =psql= prompt type the following to grant the user permissions for the
database.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydb TO myuser;
#+END_SRC

*** Fix settings.py and create tables for the models.

Make changes to =settings.py= to use the newly created database, and then
create the tables used by the app, and then load the data.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  python manage.py syncdb
  python manage.py loaddata products.json
#+END_SRC

*** Too slow!

This method worked and was reasonably fast when I was trying to get 20k rows
from a table with about 200k rows, with all the dependencies.

But, when I tried to get a dump of about 200k rows from a table with 2M rows,
it was way too slow to be of any use.  There could've been a couple of reasons
for this, which I didn't have the time to look into, and debug.

- The web-server where the =Django= app was running, and the =db= server with
  the =postgres= database were on different machines in separate datacenters,
  which could've been adding a significant amount of latency.

- Just the size of the database being much larger could be making it slower?

These are things I should be looking into and learning about, when I have more
time at hand.  For now, I needed a quicker way to get a dump.  Even though the
raw SQL route was more manual, it turned out to be much quicker.

** Raw SQL dump route
*** Get a dump of the interesting tables

First, I had to get a dump of all the tables with the data I was interested in,
one-by-one.

#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  COPY (SELECT * FROM "dataset_product" WHERE ("dataset_product"."subcategory_id" IN (319557, 94589, 332, 406, 626, 1886) AND "dataset_product"."gender_id" = 1)) TO '/tmp/products.tsv'

  COPY (SELECT * FROM "dataset_photo" WHERE "dataset_photo"."product_id" IN (SELECT U0."id" FROM "dataset_product" U0 WHERE (U0."subcategory_id" IN (319557, 94589, 332, 406, 626, 1886) AND U0."gender_id" = 1))) TO '/tmp/photos.tsv'

  -- Copy a bunch of other tables!
#+END_SRC

*** Load the data from the dumps
#+BEGIN_SRC sql
  -- syncdb
  COPY dataset_product FROM '/tmp/products.tsv' ENCODING 'UTF8';
  COPY dataset_photo FROM '/tmp/photos.tsv' ENCODING 'UTF8';
  -- Copy a bunch of other tables!
#+END_SRC

*** Make tables writable

Some of the tables did not let me write anything to them, until I [[http://centoshowtos.org/web-services/django-and-postgres-duplicate-key/][altered the
sequence]] for these tables.

*** Automating

It would be pretty nice if all of this was automated -- allow a user to enter
exactly the same kind of a query that =django-fixture-magic= lets you run, and
figure out the SQL copies that need to be done to get the requested dump. Its
something that currently would qualify as yak-shaving, but may be a handy thing
to have. Someone somewhere possibly already has something that does this.

* DONE Clock in and get-shit-done :blag:emacs:orgmode:

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: clock-in-and-get-shit-done
:EXPORT_DATE: 2015-12-22T19:47:04+05:30
:END:


I had [[./simple-org-clock-and-gnomepidgin-integration.html][setup]] a couple of hooks about an year ago that turn off all notifications
while I'm clocking in. But, I find myself switching to the browser and jumping
to twitter, out of habit.  I've tried [[https://github.com/leftnode/get-shit-done][get-shit-done]] in the past to help myself
break this habit. But enabling get-shit-done manually is step that quickly
became a non-habit.

So, I hooked up get-shit-done into an =org-clock-in-hook=.  The snippet below
is what I added into a function that is added to this hook.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (with-temp-buffer
    (cd "/sudo::/")
    (shell-command "HOME=/home/punchagan get-shit-done work"))
#+END_SRC

=get-shit-done= needs to be run as =root=, since it does things like modifying
=/etc/hosts= and restarting networking.  Just calling =get-shit-done= as a
shell command fails with the error =sudo: no tty present and no askpass program
specified=.  I found a couple of ways to fix this. The snippet above
piggy-backs on tramp to allow for a way to enter the password for =sudo= to
use. This also means that I don't need to enter the password, as long as the
tramp connection is alive.

For someone worried about having such an easy way of running something as
=root=, using something like =gnome-ssh-askpass= as the askpass program might
work better.

I have started to use [[http://pinboard.in][Pinboard]]'s =unread= tag as my to-read list.  It has a
bookmark-let that works pretty well for adding stuff into my "to-read" list.  I
then catch up on this list using =elfeed= and subscribing to the unread items'
RSS feed.  The work-flow is pretty nice for adding stuff into the list, and
finding items on the list. But, when it comes to the actual reading part, the
entries in the feed don't have the actual content I want to read, and I end up
opening the links in a browser.

Inspired by a [[https://github.com/sursh/blaggregator/pull/80#issuecomment-165849126][comment from FiloSottile]], I realized it should be pretty easy to
setup a hook that fetches the actual content to make my reading work-flow
smoother. I wrote a [[https://github.com/punchagan/dot-files/blob/master/bin/get_article.py][small script]], using [[https://github.com/buriy/python-readability][python-readability]], to fetch the page
content, given a URL. This script is then hooked onto =elfeed-new-entry-hook=,
to fetch content of for new entries as they are fetched.  All the old entries
can be easily fixed with a single call to =elfeed-apply-hooks-now=.

Staying in touch with people is something I'm not very good at.  Since I am not
on popular (among my friends/family) networks -- FB and Whatsapp -- I don't
even see random updates from people, to get some sense of being in touch.

I recently read some old posts by Sacha Chua and was inspired by how much code
she had for [[http://sachachua.com/blog/category/geek/emacs/bbdb/][contact management]] in her old blog posts.  I was inspired by [[http://sachachua.com/blog/2005/05/keeping-in-touch/][this
post]] in particular to try and be more meticulous about how I stay in touch with
people. Michael Fogleman [[https://mwfogleman.github.io/posts/08-01-2015-emacs-can-keep-in-touch.html][blogged]] about his contact management work-flow using
=keepintouch=. It seemed to do most of what I wanted, but I wanted this to be
integrated with my =org-contacts-db= and I felt having native elisp code would
make it easier to hook up email, chat, etc. to this.

I ended up writing a small utility called [[https://github.com/punchagan/howdy/][howdy]] to help me keep in touch with
people. It currently has only a couple of features:

- ~M-x howdy~ lets me update the last contacted timestamp for a contact.
- Shows me contacts that I'm out of touch in the agenda, once I add the
  following snippet to an agenda file.
  #+BEGIN_SRC org
    ,* Howdy
      %%(howdy-howdy)
  #+END_SRC

I also have a few hooks to hook up jabber messages and email to update the db.
I've added them to =howdy-hooks.el= in case anybody else wants to use them.
They can also be used as examples to write other hooks. Feel free to contribute
other hooks or suggest improvements.  The library also ships with a modest test
suite, that will hopefully make it easier for others to contribute.

I'm looking forward to experimenting with this over the next few weeks and
improving it. Hopefully, it'll help me keep in touch, better than I do now.

* DONE WiFi Channels & my router's random invisibility :blag:debugging:hardware:howto:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: wifi-channels-my-routers-random-invisibility
:EXPORT_DATE: 2015-04-22T11:48:50+05:30
:END:


To update some data plan changes, I had to restart my router today.  I did so
from the (web) admin interface, from my dad's laptop. Guess what!  The router
goes invisible (to the laptop), after the restart!  Other devices were still
happily connected.

There were a few occasions in the past when this laptop had failed to find our
home router.  The solution that worked for my dad before was to restart the
router; once, or may be a couple of times.  But, this time it didn't work.

I had a feeling this was something to do with "Channels", but I had no idea
what was going on.

I logged onto the router and started looking at the Wireless settings in the
hope of finding some clue, and there it was! =Wireless Channel: Auto Scan=

[[../../images/auto-scan.jpg]]

It was anybody's guess that some channels that the router uses weren't
supported by my dad's laptop.  The restarts *sometimes* helped because the
router would scan for channels that it thinks would work well, and end-up using
something that the laptop's wifi card supported.

The router only had options of channels from 1 to 13.  To see what channels a
wifi card supports, you can run the =iwlist freq= command.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
iwlist freq
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  eth1      26 channels in total; available frequencies :
            Channel 01 : 2.412 GHz
            Channel 02 : 2.417 GHz
            Channel 03 : 2.422 GHz
            Channel 04 : 2.427 GHz
            Channel 05 : 2.432 GHz
            Channel 06 : 2.437 GHz
            Channel 07 : 2.442 GHz
            Channel 08 : 2.447 GHz
            Channel 09 : 2.452 GHz
            Channel 10 : 2.457 GHz
            Channel 11 : 2.462 GHz
            Channel 12 : 2.467 GHz
            Channel 13 : 2.472 GHz
            Channel 14 : 2.484 GHz
            Channel 36 : 5.18 GHz
            Channel 38 : 5.19 GHz
            Channel 40 : 5.2 GHz
            Channel 42 : 5.21 GHz
            Channel 44 : 5.22 GHz
            Channel 46 : 5.23 GHz
            Channel 48 : 5.24 GHz
            Channel 149 : 5.745 GHz
            Channel 153 : 5.765 GHz
            Channel 157 : 5.785 GHz
            Channel 161 : 5.805 GHz
            Channel 165 : 5.825 GHz
#+END_SRC

So, the laptop's wifi card support all the channels that the router could use.
=iwlist freq= also gives the current Channel if the device is already connected
to a router.  I ran this on my laptop and found that the router was using
=Channel 13=.  Why the hell wouldn't this work?!  I don't know!

I decided to set a channel manually, but how do I pick a channel?  The idea of
"Auto Scan" is to find a channel that has relatively low interference.  How do
we do this manually?  =sudo iwlist scan= scans for all the WiFi access points
nearby and gives detailed information about them, which includes the Channel.

It looked like most of the routers nearby used channels 1 and 6, with a few 3s
and 4s.  Assuming, most of the other routers aren't doing this "Auto Scan"
business, I set my router to always use Channel 9, and the laptop seems to be
happily connected, now!

I've started using the wonderful [[https://github.com/np1/mps-youtube/][mpsyt]] to play any music from youtube, since
I'm not really interested in the video.  But, since I use emacs for chat/IRC, I
end up getting youtube links into emacs and opening them opens them up in my
browser. I ended up writing some =elisp= to play the songs from within an
instance of =mpsyt= running inside an emacs buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

          (term-send-string mpsyt-proc "\n\n\n")
          ;; We wait for a bit, since looking for the prompt seems to fail, sometimes?
          (sleep-for 1)
          (term-send-string mpsyt-proc "\n")

          ;; Actually send the command to playurl
          (term-simple-send (get-process mpsyt-proc-name)
                            (format "playurl %s" url)))

        (switch-to-buffer buffer)))

    (defun pc/mpsyt-url-at-point ()
      "Play the URL at point using mpsyt."
      (interactive)
      (let ((url (or (url-get-url-at-point) (pc/short-url-at-point))))
        (if (not url)
          (message "No URL found")
            (message (format "Playing %s with mpsyt" url))
          (pc/mpsyt-url url))))

#+END_SRC

The current version of mpsyt crashes when run from inside emacs due to a bug in
the code to get the terminal size, which should be fixed once this [[https://github.com/np1/mps-youtube/pull/247][patch]] is
merged.

I would've expected =thing-at-point-url-at-point= to be able to find urls even
when they don't have a schema, but it tries to guess the schema from urls and
fails to work when the url starts with =youtube.com= instead of
=www.youtube.com=.

I started off using the command-line interface of =mpsyt= by running it using
=shell-command= or =start-process=.  But, it seemed useful to have a buffer of
=mpsyt= to switch to -- easier to search for new music, repeating songs, etc.
Not all tasks/actions are achievable through =mpsyt='s command line args.

I ended up writing more code than I thought I would have to[1].  But, I'm
pretty happy with how this all works, right now.

Those who read the [[https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/learning-to-use-org-drill.html][last]] [[https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/learning-about-spaced-repetition-supermemo-org-drill-et-al.html][few]] [[https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/posts/more-input-sources-for-org-drill.html][posts]] here, would know that I have been
experimenting with [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html][org-drill]] (a spaced repetition extension to [[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode]]).  I
have been using the system (almost) religiously for the past 2 months, and I do
find that it has helped a great deal! (in some respects).  I have also spent a
considerable amount of time trying to reduce the friction to put new stuff into
the system, and am constantly on the look out for further improvements.

Using this system has definitely helped with retention, and I find that I can
recall quite a few things I have read a few weeks ago, that I would normally
have been unable to. Though, I can recall a lot of information, I have been
having a feeling of "fragmentation": the feeling of just retaining individual
bits/fragments of information, while losing out on actually internalizing the
knowledge; not seeing the big picture, etc.

Wozniak (the author of super-memo) [[http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm][warns against]] learning without
understanding, and memorizing before actually learning stuff.  I haven't
consciously added stuff into the system that I didn't understand (when I added
it), but, later it does feel like I have lost some connections or the
understanding, and am only holding onto the fragments of information.

The problems as explained in (read: as interpreted by me from) [[http://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013/ref=sr_1_1/188-6768042-2821103?ie=UTF8&qid=1421439099&sr=8-1&keywords=make+it+stick&pebp=1421439103302&peasin=674729013][Make it Stick]]
appear to be:

1. The understanding (if any) at the time of adding stuff into the
   spaced-repetition system is untested.  It may just be familiarity
   masquerading as understanding.

2. The lack of any spaced repetitions for the overall concept/understanding and
   actual repetitions only for individual bits doesn't help retention of the
   understanding (even if there was any, in the first place).

To work around this, I'm going to try adding questions that test understanding,
to the system.  The Super-memo team strongly recommends keeping the drill items
small and easy to answer.  This may be helpful in keeping each drill session
short, but I would really like to add conceptual questions to the system, and
see how it goes. I hacked =org-drill= to allow me to type out answers, before
looking at the "correct" ones.  This is an adaptation of a system that a fellow
Hacker Schooler uses, and shared.  Also, hopefully forcing myself to type out
the answer will help me get around the problem of sometimes saying "yeah I know
that", then looking at the answer only to reaffirm the feeling of familiarity,
rather than actually testing myself.  I'm still going to continue adding quick
and short questions that test "bits of information", though. But, hopefully the
additional conceptual questions are going to tie things together and help fill
in the gaps.  Lets see how this goes!

For those interested, my hacks to =org-drill= below.  The code is really a
hack, and welcome any suggestions on cleaning up the code.

* DONE How I learnt to use Emacs' profiler :emacs:orgmode:programming:

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: how-i-learnt-to-use-emacs-profiler
:EXPORT_DATE: 2015-01-03T02:01:17+05:30
:END:


I learnt to use Emacs' profiler yesterday, after many hours of yak-shaving,
trying to get [[https://github.com/novoid/Memacs][Memacs]] working.  Memacs is a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex][memory extension]] system for Emacs
written by Karl Voit, that I have been meaning to try out for a long time now.
Seeing lots of review posts at the turn of the year and watching Karl's recent
[[http://emacslife.com/emacs-chats/chat-karl-voit.html][Emacs Chat with Sacha Chua]] pushed me to try and finally set it up.

I started writing a [[https://github.com/punchagan/Memacs/blob/chrome/memacs/chromium.py][module]] to create a Memacs file -- an org archive file --
from my browser history.  It was pretty easy to write, and I had it spitting
out a huge file with 22k entries after about a couple of hours of work.  Then I
excitedly pulled up my agenda, and turned on the option to view archived
entries, only to be super-disappointed.  It turned out to be extremely slow!
Actually, the agenda never came up with the 22k entries file that I had. At
least not in 5 or so minutes, before I got impatient.  The performance was
unacceptable even when I reduced it to 5k entries.

I was pretty sure it wasn't that slow for Karl in his [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaKPr4J0K2I#t=999][demo]] and [[https://twitter.com/punchagan/status/550723377871065088][tweeted]] to him,
asking for a workaround. Meanwhile, I looked at his dot-emacs, but wasn't able
to dig out what was needed to speed up things. He confirmed that his
performance was way better than what I was getting.

First, I ruled out the possibility of it being because of the SSD, since
clearly my CPU usage was peaking, and the task was CPU bound and not I/O.
Next, I tried using the same file on a different machine (with a different
version of Emacs and org-mode), and it worked blazingly fast.  So, it was
either the version of Emacs or org-mode that I was using.

I should have stopped, thought clearly, and started experimenting with org
version, but hindsight is 20-20.  I tried Ubuntu's pre-built Emacs and agendas
were fast!  I suspected my Emacs build, since I recently started building Emacs
from git.  I built two or three other versions of Emacs, and wasted a lot of
time, before realizing that I wasn't using the org-mode source bundled inside
Emacs for the tests, and there were two "independent" variables.

Finally, I began bisecting org-mode's source and found that all hell broke
loose with an [[http://orgmode.org/w/?p=org-mode.git;a=commitdiff;h=b88c5464db2cb0d90d4f30e43b5e08d2b1c1fcea;hp=8cc4e09950594b2abec2502e9218318570595ac5][inconspicuous change]] around release 8.2.6.  It turns out that
org-overview was broken before this, and collapsing all the trees in a newly
opened org-buffer (default option) wasn't working. Once this bug was fixed,
opening huge org files would slow down by a great deal, in turn causing agenda
generation to be unbearably slow.

All I had to do was add a =#+STARTUP: showeverything= to the top of the file.
This speeded up things by about 50 times!  It turns out, I later found out,
that all of this is documented on [[http://orgmode.org/worg/agenda-optimization.html][Worg]]. I did try a few search engine queries,
but sadly none of them brought this up.  Adding the following to my config,
speeded up agenda generation by about 150-200 times!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-agenda-inhibit-startup t) ;; ~50x speedup
  (setq org-agenda-use-tag-inheritance nil) ;; 3-4x speedup
#+END_SRC

In the course of all this debugging, I learnt how to use Emacs' profiler.  The
profile reports along with git bisect, eventually helped me figure out what the
problem was.

To profile the CPU usage, all you have to do is add a call like

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (profiler-start 'cpu)  ;; or M-x profiler-start
#+END_SRC

at the place where you wish to start it.  Emacs will then start collecting
information about where time is being spent, by sampling every
=sampling-interval= seconds (default 10^6 nanoseconds = 1 milli second).

You can view the information being collected, at any point of time using

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (profiler-report) ;; or M-x profiler-report
#+END_SRC

The report is a nice, interactive tree with the percentage of time spent in
each call. You can stop profiling by calling =(profiler-stop)=.  If you have
more than one report, you can compare them by hitting ~=~ in one of the report
buffers.  I'm definitely going to use this for other things! (like speeding up
my startup?)

Now that I have Memacs working with reasonably fast agenda views, I'm looking
forward to collecting as much personal information as I can!  Thanks Karl for
writing Memacs.  I am going to be a pretty heavy user, I think!  There seem to
be a few rough edges, though, and I hope to help smoothen them out a little
bit, over the next few weeks.

I've always wanted to be able to queue up messages to send to friends, until I
go online the next time.  I tried using email instead of chat a few times, or
just ended up staying online with a busy status.

Finally, now that I have started using jabber-mode for chatting from within
Emacs, I took out the time to write a "queuing system" for sending chat
messages, similar to the mail queue for smtpmail.  Instead of persisting sexps,
though, I persist the messages in a JSON format and the queue is flushed every
time I connect to jabber, in a =jabber-post-connect-hook=.

To make the interface as similar to the interface available when I am online, I
hacked completion for the to ID using email addresses in my address book
(=mu4e~contact-list=).  I really like the fact that the chat buffer opens up,
and I can type and send messages like I usually do.  Hitting ~RET~ after typing
a message queues it up, instead of trying to send it. Smooth!

The code is in my [[https://github.com/punchagan/dot-emacs/blob/master/punchagan.org#jabber][.emacs]]

I wanted to pair with a friend of mine, exploring Magit mode in Emacs.  There
are a couple of projects to make it easy to use tmux(-like) to simplify this.

- [[https://github.com/non/pairing][pairing]] lets you share a screen and pair, on a common server where both the
  users have access to.  But I wanted to use my machine, instead of the
  server.

- [[http://tmate.io][tmate]] gets around the restriction of having a common server where both users
  have access, but needs a custom install of tmux, and the use of a 3rd party
  service.

I worked around this, using an ssh reverse tunnels.  Here are the steps, for
anyone who'd like to reproduce.

1. Add your partner(-in-crime)'s ssh key to authorized keys on a server that
   has a public IP (=example.com=, let's say).

2. Add your server's key to authorized keys on your local machine.

3. Create a reverse tunnel from your machine to the server.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     ssh -fNR 19999:localhost:22 server_user@example.com
   #+END_SRC

   =-R 19999= essentially forwards port 19999 on =example.com= to
   localhost's 22.  =-fN= is to say no terminal, send connection to background.

4. Your partner first ssh's to example.com and then ssh's to your laptop.

   On your partner's machine

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   ssh server_user@example.com
   #+END_SRC

   On the server, your partner does
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   ssh your_username@localhost -p 19999
   #+END_SRC

   Your partner is on your machine, and can run =rm -rf=!  But, hopefully
   they'll only run =tmux attach=.  Obviously, do this only with people you
   trust!

5. Start a tmux session locally.

6. Profit!

I have been trying to get ERC working with notifications. Julien Danjou's
wonderful [[https://julien.danjou.info/blog/2012/erc-notifications][notifications]] module for ERC is great, but it is annoying to get
notifications even when Emacs is in focus.

I had looked at [[https://github.com/eqyiel/circe-notifications/blob/master/circe-notifications.el][circe-notifications]], which has the feature but uses xdotool and
xprop to do it.  I was looking for something simpler, though... and it suddenly
struck me that I have an auto-save hook in Emacs that is run when I focus out
of it.  I wondered if I could disable and enable notifications on focus, and it
worked.

In case it is useful for somebody else -

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'erc-modules 'notifications)
  (erc-notifications-mode)
  (add-hook 'focus-out-hook 'erc-notifications-enable)
  (add-hook 'focus-in-hook 'erc-notifications-disable)
#+END_SRC

I wonder if there are some corner cases where this doesn't work, and that's why
the author of circe-notifications chose the tools that he did.

I've been trying to use =org-drill= regularly for the last few weeks.  I don't
know how well it's been going but I have been sticking to the routine
religiously.  I haven't yet really tried out incremental reading, but in an
attempt to make it as easy as possible, I wanted to have a pdf-reader
integration, and some kind of integration with Kindle highlights.  Browser
integration is pretty straight-forward, thanks to some [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html#sec-6][simple java-script]].

I looked for a pdf-reader with some sort of plugin support, but I found nothing
in Evince or Okular.  I thought about =pdfjs= but it seemed slightly clunky to
open pdfs in a browser, though I might shift to this if I don't like what I
finally ended up with.  Good old =xpdf= seemed to be the only pdf reader that
had some support for custom keybindings that allowed users to run external
commands.  With a [[https://github.com/punchagan/dot-emacs/blob/master/xpdf-capture][little Python]], I was able to setup a work-flow to capture
snippets from =xpdf=, to add to org-drill. Custom key-bindings somehow don't
seem to work on =xpdf= bundled on Ubuntu. So, I ended up downloading and using
the binary available on the xpdf site.

For Kindle highlights support, with minor updates to Thamer Mahmoud's [[https://github.com/punchagan/clip2org][clip2org]],
I have a simple way of getting all the "new" clippings/highlights as org-drill
headlines.  I haven't really started using this, and once I do, I may end-up
automating even the merging of these items into the org-drill notes file.  I'm
looking forward to making better use of my Kindle, with this feature!

I don't know if it would be useful to have more context information like
section titles/chapter titles when capturing from html/pdf, but it seems like
an interesting problem to try to solve.

Also, it might be easier(?) if I probably tried to have a DE level keybinding, and
some code to get selection and file name of the currently active
window/application.

I stumbled on a [[http://rubyrogues.com/178-rr-book-club-refactoring-ruby-with-martin-fowler/][Ruby Rogues podcast]] yesterday, which had [[http://martinfowlwer.com][Martin Fowler]] as the
guest.  I really enjoyed the discussion on Refactoring (the noun, the verb and
the book!)

Martin clarified in the podcast that refactoring (the verb/process) is a
sequence of very small refactorings, while you keep making sure that you can
run the test suite always.  A refactoring (noun) is a change where you change
the structure of the code without any externally observable changes, with the
intent of making it easier to understand and cheaper to change in future.

I also really liked the metaphor of a 'healthy code base'.  Refactoring is,
then, the process of keeping healthy -- exercise, speaking metaphorically.  You
can stack up all the exercise you need to do, until you get really unfit.
Refactoring, similarly, needs to be done regularly, to keep the code base
healthy.  This lets you go faster, in the future.

I also really liked the advise about trying to push back the mental contexts
you build, while trying to debug/understand some code that is not very clear,
by refactoring the code to make it clearer.  Code needn't be one big chunk of
cryptographic text.  Code is writing.  It should be clear and understandable.
Or, at least we should strive to make it so!

The discussion, as always on this podcast, was very lively, pleasant and
enjoyable! Enjoy!

I have been reading a bunch of articles on the SuperMemo site (including the
[[http://www.supermemo.com/english/ol.htm][original thesis]] of P. A. Wozniack, the creator of SuperMemo).  I initially
started off trying to understand the algorithms SM2,5 and 8 which org-drill
implements, but reading the articles has given me a lot of general background
and theory on how memory works, and why SuperMemo is as effective as it is (for
those who stick with it).  This blog post is an attempt to summarize and
capture what I have read in all those [[http://www.supermemo.com/english/contents.htm][articles]], and not get lost in them.  I
would recommend reading the thesis and the suggested reading there, yourself,
but if you really don't want to -- this blog post + the summary in [[http://www.supermemo.com/articles/20rules.htm#Prioritize][here]], and
[[http://www.supermemo.com/articles/decalog.htm#decalog][here]] would be a good alternative.

- Memory works by repetition.  Each time you recall a fact, the time it takes
  for the memory to fade increases.  Spaced repetition is the idea of repeating
  items, just when you are about to forget them -- trying to optimize the time
  spent on learning, as well as the retention of learned material.

- Prioritization of the items we need to learn is key to being able to stick to
  Spaced repetition.  Beginners tend to be over-enthusiastic about the
  technique and fill up their system with stuff that they don't really care
  about.  Applicability of the knowledge you are trying to gain, is a good test
  for whether or not it goes into your system.

- Each version of SuperMemo comes with a slightly modified (on most occassions,
  improved!) algorithm.  SM2, SM5, ... refer to these algorithms. Org-drill
  currently supports only sm2,5 and 8.  It may be worth looking at sm15/16 and
  seeing if it can be implemented and is worth doing.  In any case, using any
  of these is *way* better than not using Spaced repetition at all.

- Understanding what we are trying to learn goes a long way in helping
  memory. It is, therefore, good to start with basic material. People have been
  surprised by how easily the advanced stuff fell into place, once they had the
  basics covered.

- Keep items in the system simple.  Stick to the minimum information
  principle.  Keeping it simple, doesn't mean you leave out on learning the
  complex stuff; instead break it into simpler components.  Simpler items has
  the following advantages:

  - Simple is easier to remember.
  - Simpler items are easier to schedule.  You get more resolution to figure
    out what the problem areas are.
  - Simple makes brings in redundancy automatically.  And [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Redundancy_is_good][redundancy is good]]
    for memory, just like it is for managing hardware failure.

- Keep learning fun!  Don't make review sessions a chore.  Think about the
  material you are reviewing. Edit/delete/improve items based on your reviews,
  then and there. Stay active.

- It is useful to add a link to the source of the items added to your system,
  considering that you wish to use the system over a long period of time
  (ideally, the rest of your life!)

- Prioritize, add examples, appeal to your emotional state, link to existing
  knowledge, use images. Anything else that works for you!  Use all of these
  techniques, that work well and you probably already use in everyday life, in
  the items you add to your system, to make them easier to recall.

- Being physically fit and healthy is important for being so
  mentally. Exercise, sleep, eat well, avoid caffeine.

- Try [[http://www.supermemo.com/help/read.htm][incremental]] [[http://www.supermemo.com/articles/devour.htm][reading]], as an input source of items into your memory system.

*See update [[Update <2014-11-01 Sat>][below]]*

I have been trying to get back to using org-mode and its clocking
functionality, more often than not.  I used to use it a lot, a few years ago,
and haven't been using it, since I had been in my last job.

To help with it, I decided to integrate clocking in and out with changing
status on Pidgin, and turning notifications on and off in Gnome.  Here's a few
lines of code that does this for me.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(defadvice org-clock-in (after pc/org-clock-in (&optional select start-time))
  "Turn gnome notifications off."
  (dbus-send-signal

   "/org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence"
   "org.gnome.SessionManager.Presence"
   "SetStatus" 2)
  (shell-command "purple-remote setstatus?status=unavailable"))

(defadvice org-clock-out (after pc/org-clock-out (&optional switch-to-state fail-quietly at-time))
  "Turn gnome notifications back on."

   "/org/gnome/SessionManager/Presence"
   "org.gnome.SessionManager.Presence"
   "SetStatus" 0)
  (shell-command "purple-remote setstatus?status=available"))

#+END_SRC

** Update <2014-11-01 Sat>

[[http://baali.muse-amuse.in][@baali]] tried to use my code, and it turns out it didn't work for him, because I
forgot to mention that =(ad-activate 'org-clock-in)= needs to be run, after the
=defadvice= code.  I have no idea how it worked for me, without doing that.
May be because I have =defadvice= for other functions?

Also, while debugging this, I found that =defadvice= is a deprecated way of
doing this, and =add-function= is the way to go now.  But, instead of advising
the function, I decided to make use of =org-clock-in-hook=.

Here is the new code.

I've [[./notes-from-pycon.html][ranted before]] about PyCon not meeting my expectations, and I even skipped
going to the last PyCon.  Somehow, I hoped that it would be better this year,
but no such thing happened.

- I should strictly not attend any talks, at the next conference I am at.  Even
  if the topic seems interesting, I should refrain from attending any talks,
  unless I know that a speaker is entertaining.

- I should be going there to meet old friends, meet a few new people, and
  mostly hacking on my stuff.  May be aim to show something at the lightning
  talks at the end of second day, based on what I did during the rest of the
  event.

- Participate more actively in open spaces, and may be initiate or suggest some
  myself.  Sprints for bug fixing, adding new features to a project may be a
  good way to get new developers to start contributing to FOSS projects.  It
  would be even better to be in touch with folks before the event, and use this
  opportunity to iron out kinks.

I think the talks could be improved drastically. A lot[1][2] has been said,
already.  Here's a summary of how I see it.

- Beginner/Novice talks doesn't mean bad talks.  A talk with a good narrative,
  that drives home a point, that may be familiar to most of the audience, would
  still make a good talk.  I don't mind reading a good blog post/book on a
  topic I already know, because there is joy in reading/listening to "good"
  stuff.

- Talks cannot be judged by titles or an abstract.  Taking inspiration from
  PyCon US, we could

  - Ask for a video recording of a previous talk or a short home-made
    recording of the speaker presenting some topic.

  - Ask for a granular outline [6] along with rough timing information, instead of
    just an abstract.

  - Have a bunch of resources [3][4][5] available for speakers to improve on their
    proposals/accepted talks.

  - Have a bunch of 20 or 30 minute talks, and very few longer (45 min) talk
    slots.

  - Encourage speakers to try connecting their laptops and iron out
    "presentation" kinks on the day before their talks/lunch/other allotted
    times. Technical issues like fonts being too small, mics not working,
    adjusting the volume/other settings for the speaker, etc. can and should be
    fixed before hand.

  - The talk review committee could also take notes from attending some of the
    talks, and compare it against their notes when they accepted the talk, to
    improve the talk selection process.  Some of it could be valuable feedback
    for the speakers too.

Org-drill is an Org-mode extension that provides spaced-repetition and
flash-card functionality.  It has a [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html][wonderful documentation on Worg]], but
somehow I couldn't get myself to read the whole document, and setup org-drill,
until now.

The setup is quite straight forward, once you have org-mode along with the
=contrib= packages.  Just =(require 'org-drill)=, and you are all set!  To add
a new card, all you need to do is add a =:drill:= tag to the items you wish to
"Org-drill".  You can start a review session with simply ~M-x org-drill~.  You
will be shown flash cards, and you can rate how correct and comfortable you
were, in answering the questions.  Based on your responses, the cards are
scheduled for review.  Start another review session, whenever you need one!

What I could only understand once I got myself to read the whole document was
that:

- The default scope of a drill session is the current file.  But, you can start
  sessions with scopes like current tree, current directory, or a specified
  list of files. This is super-useful!

- The review sessions are not automatically scheduled, based on when you
  schedule failed flash-cards.  Scheduling the review for a card only sets a
  due-date for them, and effects, what you are asked in your next session.

Cram mode and incremental reading are also things I want to try, as I go along.

Happy Learning!

  School's OAuth2 API, and hit a roadblock on the first step of
  requesting an authorization from the user.  Once the user authorized
  my app, I would see an error that said, "The authorization server
  does not support this response type".  I was using a client library
  that I had [[https://github.com/litl/rauth][used before]], and the server was using a what seemed like
  a [[https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper][popular implementation]] for ruby on rails.  Getting weird errors is
  not done!

  I have used OAuth2 based authentication [[https://github.com/punchagan/statiki/blob/master/statiki.py#L49][before]], but the thought of
  using it always makes me a little nervous, just because

  1. I don't understand it very well.
  2. Like almost everything else, there seem to be so many libraries
     for doing this in Python, and I'm never sure which one to use, or
     which one I used the last time around.  Not understanding the
     protocol also doesn't let me debug anything that comes up.

  To fix this, I set about to read and understand the [[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749][OAuth2 protocol]].
  This blog post is an attempt to record it for future reference, and
  possibly act as a reference for others.

** Why OAuth

  OAuth is simply a way for an end-user to allow third parties to use
  protected data, without sharing the user's credentials with the
  third-party.

  For example, an end-user (Jane) can grant a printing service
  (Printo) access to her protected photos stored at a photo-sharing
  service (Picasa), without sharing her username and password with the
  printing service.  Instead, she authenticates directly with a server
  trusted by the photo-sharing service, which issues the printing
  service delegation-specific credentials. (example from the OAuth 2.0
  spec)

** Protocol Flow

   #+BEGIN_SRC ditaa

   +----------+                               +---------------+
   |          |--(A)- Authorization Request ->|   Resource    |
   |          |                               |     Owner     |
   |          |<-(B)-- Authorization Grant ---|     (Jane)    |
   |          |                               +---------------+
   |          |
   |          |                               +---------------+
   |          |--(C)-- Authorization Grant -->| Authorization |
   | Client   |                               |     Server    |
   | (Printo) |<-(D)----- Access Token -------|    (Google)   |
   |          |                               +---------------+
   |          |
   |          |                               +---------------+
   |          |--(E)----- Access Token ------>|    Resource   |
   |          |                               |     Server    |
   |          |<-(F)--- Protected Resource ---|    (Picasa)   |
   +----------+                               +---------------+

   #+END_SRC


   The flow occurs through a sequence of user actions, client requests
   and user-agent (browser) redirects.

   - (A) Printo asks Jane to allow using Picasa Data. The request can
     be sent directly to Jane, but is usually routed via
     Picasa/Google.

   - (B) Printo gets back an authorization grant, which is a
     credential representing Jane's authorization or approval.  The
     type of the actual grant credential depends on the type of
     request that Printo used.

   - (C, D) Printo gets back to Google with the credentials it obtained
     in the previous step and obtains a token that it can use to talk
     with Picasa.

   - (E, F) Printo asks for the desired photo with the token it
     obtained previously, and Picasa gives back the photo to print.
     Jane gets her framed photo!

   But before any of this happens, the client needs to register with
   the authorization server and obtain a =client_id= and
   =client_secret=, that will be used to identify the client making
   the requests.

** Pythonized "authorization code" work-flow.

  The OAuth2 spec allows the authorization request/grant to be of 4
  different types.  It also allows some flexibility in the token
  type.

  In my experience, the most common work-flow seems to be using an
  /authorization code/ as an authorization grant, and using a /Bearer/
  type token.  This work-flow is explained in the diagram below (taken
  from the spec document).  This diagram zooms in, onto the steps A-D
  in the diagram above.

     |         |<---(E)----- Access Token -------------------'
     +---------+       (w/ Optional Refresh Token)

   Note: The lines illustrating steps (A), (B), and (C) are broken into
   two parts as they pass through the user-agent.

  This [[https://gist.github.com/punchagan/76e8771fc26cd243f3ac][python code snippet]] is a simple implementation of this
  workflow, using the Hacker School API.

  {{{gist(76e8771fc26cd243f3ac)}}}

** Conclusion

  I think, I understand the OAuth2 spec a lot better now, and hope
  that this will help others understand it, too.  And more
  importantly, I won't get nervous when I have to add it to my
  projects.

  Also, [[https://github.com/idan/oauthlib][oauthlib]] for Python seems to be a pretty thorough
  implementation of the spec, and [[https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib][requests-oauthlib]] seems to wrap it
  for use with requests.  I think I'm going to use this in my future
  projects.

[[http://binchen.org/][Chen Bin]] asked me to share my Nikola+Org work-flow, and share an
example post.

The org source for any post can be found by changing the URL of a post
from =.html= to =.org=.

I don't have much of a work-flow, because I don't post too often, but
here is what I typically do, to make a new post.

I start off by creating a new post using

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ nikola new_post
#+END_SRC

and then give the post a title and start editing the post in Emacs.

I have a simple snippet that lets me insert tags, based on existing
tags.

{{{gist(6629020)}}}

Once I'm happy with the content of a post, I run =nikola auto= to
build the source and serve it locally, and see if the post "looks"
reasonable, after being rendered.

Once, I'm happy with it, I commit the post and deploy it using =nikola
deploy=.

I also have a plugin, that posts captured bookmarks and quotes onto
the blog, with a single command. I should probably make the sources of
my blog open, and push it onto GitHub.

*Update [2015-05-13 Wed]*

- I use my own [[https://plugins.getnikola.com/#orgmode][plugin]] for Nikola which lets me write posts in org-mode.  There
  is a similar [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/org2nikola][plugin]] by Chen Bin, that exports posts to intermediate html,
  that is then used by Nikola.

- The source for my blog is now on [[https://github.com/punchagan/punchagan.muse-amuse.in][GitHub]]

- I also have [[https://github.com/punchagan/dot-emacs/blob/master/punchagan.org#nikola-stuff][custom elisp]] to be able to make a new post, and deploy the site
  from within Emacs.

At home, my video would always show a silhouette in G+ and Skype, and
I always thought that this was because the lighting at home was not
sufficient.  At office, the video was decent.  But, moving to sit
right under the light also didn't help much.

Struggling with a bunch of tools like =v4lctl=, =guvcview= didn't
help. But, during these struggles I noticed that =cheese= would show
me bright and cheerful, while all the other programs showed my
silhouette.

I set out to "fake" the output of =cheese= as a video device that
skype and other programs could use. But, I didn't have to go all the
way.  I ended up using [[https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback/][v4l2loopback]] to create a loopback video device,
and just using =gst-launch= to redirect video to that device, did the
trick!  Thanks gstreamer!  Thanks v4l2loopback! :)

I was playing around with a few ideas for creating a timeline for the

that idea, I ended up wanting to scrape all the emails on our google

that claims to be able to do this.

So I ended up writing my own [[https://gist.github.com/punchagan/7947337][hacky script]] to download all the emails
sent on the group.  Like I said, this is a hack and can be improved
quite a bit, but I am not inclined to do anything about it, right
now.  Since, everything about google groups is ajaxy, this script uses
selenium and does things on the page, that one would do by hand.  It's
not something that I am proud of, but it does the job!

It was a pleasant Saturday evening in the middle of the winter. Christmas was
just round the corner and love in the air. The sun was just setting and
everything outside his window was given a fresh coat of snow, tickled by the
red, quickly fading light. Not that he noticed. He stared blankly out of the
window, looking at nothing in particular. He had just woken up from his
afternoon nap; but he'd buy it if you told him he'd been sleeping for a year...

You could see the icy river crawling ahead, from his window.  People walking
over the bridge, a few camera flashes going off, people stopping over and
looking far ahead into the horizon -- collecting their thoughts, couples
walking hand-in-hand enjoying each others' company; You could see it all, from
up there! But, as they say, you only see what you look for. And he, couldn't
see any of this. His looked out of his window and saw none of this.

He is walking down the same bridge. He didn't know where he was going; his head
at least. His legs did; as always. He was walking down in his regular yellow
shirt and black jeans, that you could mistake for a uniform, if you followed
him for a few days. Extremely under-dressed for the chilly night, one would
say. He kept walking down the main street, lined with shops brightly lit up for
the festive season. The pavement bustled with with people walking with a spring
in their step -- the spring that the festive season and all the love in the air
brought to you. Not that he noticed it, or had any of it in his step.

Soon, he's walking through the park. The park that was built to celebrate time,
ticking away furiously. Or to celebrate the time everyone in the world had, to
enjoy themselves. He walked past the skating rink, with lots of people having
the time of their life, ice skating; and a lot more, awaiting their turn. The
first timers, old and young, making up for their inexperience, with their
excitement; holding onto whatever they can, to finish each round, to start the
next! The veterans, taking the center-stage and showing off their moves!  He
was barely aware of their presence and just walked on, past all the action.

The music festival; he walked past it too, like the crowd didn't exist, the
noise didn't, the music didn't; like there was nothing happening! The fountain
"felt" no different. The cold breeze, did sprinkle the water to quite a
distance and everybody kept a safe distance to avoid the chilling shower,
except for the kids, who found it amusing to run into the shower for a split
second and run back madly. How could he walk just by it, and not feel a thing!

The lakefront. That is where his legs always brought him in the end. The
brilliantly lit skyline was a delight to watch, but I don't believe he saw any
of it. He just stared into it, blankly. He kept staring, as the night got
chillier and the surroundings kept getting more and more deserted. Seconds
ticked away, minutes and hours passed by! He stayed on, staring ahead. It
didn't matter how much below zero the mercury had gone. This wasn't the first
night he was spending staring into the nothingness. It turned out to be the
coldest night, in a decade. But that didn't matter to him. Nothing did. Nothing
has, for a while now; Ever since he turned cold.

[[http://twitter.com/avudem][Voodoo]] found a broken link referring to a one of my posts, on Quora.

I used to have a separate page for bookmarks and quotes on the old
blog.  They will now be shared as regular posts with 5 or more
bookmarks/quotes.  I use a bookmarklet in my browser to capture links
to an org-file using org-capture protocol and then I have a small
plugin to Nikola, that looks at such captured bookmarks and quotes and
makes new posts out of them.  This workflow is inspired by Brett
Trepestra's [[http://brettterpstra.com/2013/01/15/a-web-excursions-system-for-static-blogs/][web excursions]] plugin.

The plugin is currently a part of my blog source, and not published to
Nikola's plugin repository since it is very specific to my setup.  But
if anybody is interested, I can publish the code somewhere public.

If you are interested to get these links and bookmarks into your feed reader,
you can subscribe to their feed: [quotes], [[https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/tags/cat_bookmarks.xml][bookmarks]].  These posts will also
make it to the main feed, though.

Sigh! I made yet another change to the way this blog gets published.
But, I have a feeling this mechanism, is here to stay!

We've been using Nikola quite regularly for our [[http://ultimatesport.in][Ultimate site]], and I
quite like it.  I've also contributed a bunch of features to Nikola to
get it to work the way I would like it to.  This weekend I ported my
blog from [[https://github.com/renard/o-blog][o-blog]] to [[http://getnikola.com][Nikola]].  The only thing that was stopping me
from doing it, until now is the fact that all my posts are in
org markup and porting them over to one of the formats that Nikola
supports would be a PITA.  So, I wrote a [[http://plugins.getnikola.com/#orgmode][pretty simple plugin]] to
Nikola to support posting from org files.  And then with a [[https://gist.github.com/punchagan/6970578][little
Python]], I was able to move everything over to use Nikola.

Hopefully, I'll keep my blog more updated, from here on!

glanced through, and was hurriedly marked as unread, starred and

the flurry with which I was stowed away, I probably contain
something important, to be read at the opportune moment, something
to be cherished and to be replied to with diligence and care.  I
felt a sense of pride.

I got composed and sent weeks ago, and have been lying here
untouched, since.  I get buried deeper and deeper every day, with
a daily flood of newer stuff piling up onto me.  While my
composer, eagerly awaits a reply, (less and less eagerly each day,

curse myself for carrying something so important.  A thousand

About 20 of us, gathered at Andheri Station, to leave for Surat.
I was the only one playing in his/her first tournament, and it was
exciting to be a part of a squad, going to a tournament.  A first
in my life.  We had two teams, A and B, or better known as Storm
and Chasers.  I was playing for the Chasers team.  The train
journey was pretty uneventful for me, unfortunately so, because of
a mixed up ticket booking and only 4 of us, sitting in the AC
coach.  I ended up reading or sleeping for most part of the
journey.  I didn't realize, we could just walk into the other
coach where most of the others were having a lot of fun!

Fountainhead School was the venue for the tournament, and they
had arranged for transport, accommodation and food and drinks,
all through the tournament.  The organization for the tournament
was pretty good, I must say!  We had a bus pick us up at the
railway station, and getting into the bus felt like we were some
big team with our own team bus, and stuff (though, there was also
the Silent Voice team on the bus ;).  Ganesh and I had a little
chat in the bus, and he was recollecting his experiences in his
first tournament, and was asking me what I expected from the
tournament, and I didn't really have a good answer, because I was
too excited.  But, I really enjoyed the chat with him.

We all crashed at the school library for the night, for a hard day
in the field on the next day.  We rushed to the field, early next
morning, about half a km of walk from the school, the playing
field was in the middle of some fields and we warmed up to a
lovely sun rise.  Storm had their first game at 7, against Dream
Catchers, and they started a little rusty in the first half, but
came back strongly in the second one to beat them 11-7.  This was
going to be closest their opposition was going to come to winning!
Chasers had their first game against Silent Voice, a team from
Ahmedabad.  We got together as a team for the first time, really,
and having just one substitute player didn't really help much.  We
got thrashed by Silent voice, 11-4 or 11-5.  Chasers got the next
game as a bye, since Lay Lapak failed to turn up for the
tournament and this meant we slid up the table and got to play the
Dream Catchers from Ahmedabad.  Craig reached in time, from
Mumbai, for this game, and we gave them a decent fight in this
game, though the score line didn't really suggest it.  We were
doing way too many mistakes (and repeating them!) near the
end-zones and they were costing us a lot.  The highlight of these
games, though, was the spectacular layouts by Cheerag on D. Storm,
meanwhile, thrashed the HAT team 11-0, and beat Surat Trailblazers
convincingly.

A lot of the teams had school kids on them, who were playing
astonishingly well.  The pick out of those was Jumbish, which had
10 to 15 year olds, jumping all over the place and giving their
opposition a run for their money.  The moment of the tournament
for me was a catch by a Jumbish player, who jumped ahead of him,
to take a catch, flipped over in the air without placing his hands
on to the ground, and landed on his feet and made a perfectly nice
pass to his team-mate!  Exciting stuff to watch!  Pune also has a
nice Ultimate program for kids, and their team Royal Spirits was
playing some good Ultimate.

The last game of the day was Storm vs. Flying Spirits from Pune,
who were second on the points table, after Storm.  But Storm was
clinical in their execution, and "Bagel-ed" [read as, thrashed
11-0] Flying Spirits.

At the end of the day, we had a good dinner and lots of ice-cream
and discussed our favorite moments of the day.  I felt proud to
have featured in atleast one person's favorite moments, in my
first tournament! W00t!  Some of us fooled around on the dance
floor for a while, to some Gujarati and Bollywood music.

The next day started with us playing Royal Spirits (Pune).  We
started off strongly, but ended up giving away some easy scores
towards the end of the game, and ended up drawing the game at 6
all.  Our next game against Storm was another Bagel for Storm.
They played zone on us, and though we were as patient as we could
be, we simply didn't have enough skill and team work to score
against them.  Our next game against Flying Spirits was a very
good game, and I'd rate it the best amongst our games.  We played
a good stack and played hard on D, and were able to keep the
scores at 5-5 until the last 5 minutes, when they scored and
finished winners.  The Flying Spirits admitted to us giving them a
good competition and making them work hard for their goals.  Our
last game was against Zero Gravity, a team from the school
itself, and our first victory!  We started off pretty strongly,
and were able to finish the game 10-5.

The final between Storm and Cats-Dogs (Delhi) was so much fun to
watch.  Storm stuck to their clinical performance and everyone
seemed to be playing at their best!  They came out winners 13-4
in a game that lasted close to an hour and a half.  All the other
games, btw, were games-to-11 and time capped to 55 minutes.
Storm also managed to win the Spirit award for the tournament,
and it is the first time in Indian Ultimate's history that a team
won both the tournament and the spirit award!

The tournament was a lot of fun and a lot of learning for me.  I
learnt a lot of things from everyone playing there, specially from
the players in Storm.  I know I'll carry forward some wonderful
memories from my first tournament, thanks to everyone from Storm
Chasers and everybody else, who I played against.  I really liked
the idea of spirit circles after the games, where each team
discussed the game and appreciated the other team about particular
aspects of their team and play and suggested areas that they could
work on, to improve themselves.  I also hung out around some of
the spirit circles of Storm and their opposition and I really
loved listening to Apu speak to the opposition.  On almost every
occasion, it gave me goosebumps!  Thanks Apu, for showing us, what
the spirit of the game should mean to each of us.  Ganesh
mentioned, in the chat we had on the bus to the school, that I'd
learn a lot more than just Ultimate, and it turned out to be true.
I got to learn a lot about my team, and everybody on Storm
chasers.  I experienced what it feels like, to be a part of a
squad or a team, for the first time and it feels great, in short!
Thanks Ganesh for the chat, and all the inspiration on-and-off the
field.  In the middle of one of the games, Willis walked up to me
and told me to be more confident on the field and move more
crisply on the field.  I'm not sure, that will change in one game,
but that is something I'll remember for a long time to come.
Kayleigh reminded me of one of the good catches I took on day-1,
by having it in her favorite moments of the day.  As someone
playing in his first tournament, that's a pretty big deal!  Thanks
to Willis and Kayleigh for all the encouragement, guidance and
training!  Thanks to Parag for drilling it into our team, that we
are going to keep the game's tempo high, but our tempers low.  The
tournament was much more fun, that way.  Thanks to Robo for giving
me the cleats, and the encouragement during many a practice
session.  Thanks to Rose for being the wonderful captain that she
was, thanks to Cheerag for showing us how much one can give on D,
thanks to Craig, Diti, Rakesh, Sheryll and Vishal for being
supportive and being patient with me and all my blunders.  Thanks
to Pixie for all the morning practice sessions, while we were
waiting for everyone else to turn up.  Thanks to Mak for help from
the shouting helping me out from the side lines.  Thanks to Jimmy,
Megna, and Sarah, for making me feel a part of the squad, and for
being a part of the wonderful Storm!  Here are some pictures,
thanks to Shantanu and Saurabh, who traveled all the way to Surat
to watch, cheer and capture!

Even if, our team won just one out of the 6 games we played, it
was an Ultimate tourney.  Literally!  Looking forward to future
tournaments.

Shantanu and I gave a short talk titled "Software Carpentry for
Scientists" for the graduate students of Chemical Engineering
department, IISc, this Friday.  We gave a short introduction to
Git, TDD, Numpy/Scipy, etc and mentioned a few things from Greg
Wilson et al's paper.

I promised to revert to them with links to a few resources.  I
figured it would be more beneficial, if I just put it in a
publicly available place.

** Summary of paper by Greg Wilson et. al.
  1. Write programs for people, not computers
     - a program should not require its readers to hold more than a
           handful of facts in memory at once.
     - names should be consistent, distinctive and meaningful.
     - code style and formatting should be consistent.
     - all aspects of software development should be broken down
           into tasks roughly an hour long
  2. Automate repetitive tasks
     - rely on the computer to repeat tasks
     - save recent commands in a file for re-use
     - use a build to automate scientific work-flows
  3. Use the computer to record history
     - software tools should be used to track computational work
       automatically.
  4. Make incremental changes
     - work in small steps with frequent feedback and course
       correction
  5. Use version control
     - use a version control system
     - everything that has been created manually should be put in
       version control
  6. Don't repeat yourself (or others)
     - every piece of data must have a single authoritative
       representation in the system
     - code should be modularized rather than copied and pasted
     - re-use code instead of rewriting it
  7. Plan for mistakes
     - add assertions to programs to check their operation
     - use an off-the-shelf unit testing library
     - use all available oracles when testing programs
     - turn bugs into test cases
     - use a symbolic debugger
  8. Optimize software only after it works correctly
     - use a profiler to identify bottlenecks
     - write code in the highest-level language possible
  9. Document design and purpose, not mechanics
     - document interfaces and reasons, not implementations
     - refactor code instead of explaining how it works
     - embed the documentation for a piece of software in that software
  10. Collaborate
      - use pre-merge code reviews
      - use pair programming when bringing someone new up to speed
        and when tackling particularly tricky problems
      - use an issue tracking tool

Just making a note for myself:

1. Use StringIO if speed doesn't matter so much.
2. Whenever possible, just convert the input to StringIO to a

Here are some very generic (and paraphrased) notes from a short
talk today, by Deepankar Sharma.

1. Whenever you release a new major version, make sure you keep a
   copy of the whole "ecosystem" to be able to run it whenever you
   want.  At any point in time, you should be able to run any
   version of your software.
2. When writing benchmarks/tests/etc., try and ensure that you
   cover a broad spectrum of test data, to try and replicate the
   different types of data that users could possibly have.
3. Don't develop applications with modes.  Be very careful before
   you add a new mode to your application, effectively adding one
   more code path to maintain.
4. (Bonus) Beware of too much extensibility

The ripples on the quiet lake,
twinkling stars on a moonless night,
and his lonely, crazy, thoughts,
yet again, his faithful companions
on another of those countless nights,
searching for meaning, awaiting the dawn.

the night crawled by, as he drifted afloat,
memories of the past and dreams of the future,
until approaching footsteps, brought him back
did the chill of the wind, get to his head?
or was his guarded secret, not his anymore?

Before his thoughts, collect, he could,
his friend, from far away lands unknown,
was there with him, to share his thoughts,
to hear the wind hum the tunes of yore,
while the stars and the lake, as a duo, danced.

They watch the sun rise, from atop the hillock,
basking in the warmth, and see the town wake up,
lose themselves in the woods below,
on their way back, rest by the lake shore,
watching it, silently, shine in the daylight,
letting it wet their feet and clear his head.

Together, they cook themselves, a delicious meal,
n enjoy it, with some of the choicest old wine.
Catch-up on things, and yearn for more, discuss
all the many things, under the sun, and over,
without a clue, as to how much time flew by.

Riding away, as fast as they could, they reach,
just in time, as the sun set, over the seas,
perched on bicycles, in mirrored positions, with
resonating thoughts, the horizon, they watch
the sun set, the beach light up, and the fair begin.

They ate and drank, sung and danced and
just had a good time, for the rest of the night,
indulging, in all that the fair could offer.
the night was long, but if wouldn't go on forever,
pretty well, they knew, they day was to end.

the twinkling stars they watched, yet again,
but to the sea's song, on the still warm sand
slowly, but steadily, into sleep he drifted,
only to be awake, moments later, with the
bright sun coming harshly down upon him,
lighting up the lake, like a carpet of jewels.

all he had, once again, were just his thoughts,
the lake, and not the sea, by his side,
with fading impressions of an impossible dream
after all, wasn't it just too much action,
for just one day, for a life engulfed by ennui?

One some day, he told himself, and walked away.

But, this time, I proposed a couple of talks, and both of them
have been accepted! Woot! Lots of work ahead of me, but I'm
really looking forward to give good talks.  I'll be talking
about Enaml, and showing a brief demo of all the wonderful
things it makes possible.  In the other talk, I'll give a
brief overview of the latest happenings in the SciPy community
and the projects to look forward to and contribute to.  Pankaj
and I will be talking together on this.


Also, Kenneth (lawgon) will be deeply missed at this edition

I bought a new bike, about a month ago, and today was the first
longish ride on it.  Well, longish compared to my ~1.5km rides to
the office.

At 19:45, I just set out to get some fresh air.  After sitting for
two days, inside the house, by the evening on Sunday, I tend to
get stuffy.  I started riding westward and the fresh air got to my
head, I ended up pedaling too far away to get back, without going
to the beach.  It was fun, having adrenaline pumping all over.
But, there was much more traffic than I would've liked.  Anyway,
one shower on the way up, and one puncture on the way back
(thankfully, close enough to my house), it was a fun ride on the
whole.

I didn't time myself, but I roughly covered about 25 kms in say
about ~2 hours.  Hoping to start riding more frequently and going
on longer rides.

One of the things with git that you can mess-up, if you are not
used to, is git diff.  A friend of mine was trying to add a couple
of new files, and changes to existing files.  But, he was on the
wrong branch, and wanted to change to a different branch, before
committing.  Being new to git, he wanted to take a patch.  Reset
the changes, apply the patch back.

This is what he did

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git add new_file.txt
  git add old_file1.txt old_file2.txt # don't add old_file3.txt
#+END_SRC

Oh, damn, I want to change the branch.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git diff > a.patch
  git reset --hard
  git checkout other-branch
#+END_SRC

Let me commit my changes...

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git apply a.patch
  git commit -m
  git show
#+END_SRC

Oh crap!  Where are my new files?  They aren't commited!  Lemme
add them.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ls new_file.txt
  ls: cannot access new_file.txt: No such file or directory
#+END_SRC

Dammit!  Where are my changes gone?

The problem was with =git diff=.  It gives only the only the
un-staged changes.  =--cached= option has to specified, to get the
staged changes in the diff output.  =git diff HEAD= shows diff
output with both staged and un-staged changes.

But the whole workflow above is a beginners workflow.  A user
comfortable with git would've committed and then moved the commit
around using cherry-pick or the like.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git add <all-files>
  git commit -m "My awesome changes."  #committed on branch1
  git checkout other-branch
  git cherry-pick branch1

A few days back, a couple of friends and I were discussing, how
anything sells in India and how opening a restaurant is seemingly
an easy way to make some quick bucks.  But, now, I have a much
better plan to make some big money, may be not so quickly, but
definitely a lot more -- at least by an order of magnitude.

Religion!  Nothing sells like it, in the land of snake charmers!
People will buy anything on offer.  This post gives the recipe for
turning a small temple in a _god forsaken_ town, into a big place
of worship that "attracts" devotees from all over the country, if
not the world!

The first task would be to zero-in on a temple.  But before that,
let's define the kind of town we are interested in.  Ideally, the
town should be within a couple of hundred kilometers away from a
city with good transport connectivity and a population at around
one and a half million (There are about 20 such cities, in the
country).  The temple in question could piggy back on the fame of
a temple nearby, if it is within about 50 kilometers of a really
famous temple, but in that case, our temple would remain the
second preference, for a very long time to come.  But this is much
easier to accomplish and arguably a quicker buck.  Ideally,
though, we'd prefer a location, which doesn't have any other
famous temples in the radius of about 300 kms (roughly 5-6 hours
by road).  It also helps if the travel to the temple for the big
city is through the country side, giving a glimpse of the country
side that urban Indians can only dream of connecting, the life
that was once lived by their parents and grandparents, but they
now only get to see in the movies.  This will help us score some
points with the "educated and sophisticated" urban populace.

Now, the temple.  It should be the biggest or the only one in
town, though having smaller temples around helps in knitting more
tales around the temple.  The temple in question should be one,
that the locals have tremendous faith in.  You should be able to
find at least a dozen people who vouch for the miraculous power of
the gods in there, without trying too hard.  That should be good
enough, to get you going, and I believe this isn't too hard for
any random temple, anywhere in the country.

The gods.  It really doesn't matter who the god is.  He/she could
either be a generalist or a specialist and that would influence
the type of crowds coming in.  Your god can be as specialized as
you like, up to the extent of specializing in blessing people get
visas to the US.  Now, your god can either be an already well
known god, or a not so well known incarnation of a well known god,
or a new person who is soon to become god!  The first type is a
hard bet; the third option is somewhat high risk too, and you'll
really need to put your mind to it, to make it work.  The second
option is the easiest one.  It always helps to have some real
objects and places that can be associated with the god, and are
living proof that the god once lived here and used those things.
It really helps if you can give the devotees the feeling that they
are doing all the things that the god in question once used to do,
at the same places he/she used to do it.  Type-3 gods would work
well for this.

Spread the word.  This, obviously, is the most important part and
the hardest one too.  It's best to start with the word of mouth.
Start with family and friends and friends of friends and friends
of friends of friends (read as facebook-only-friends).  Pick the
more religious of the lot, encourage them to visit the place,
write and share blog posts/tweets/pictures/tales/stories and
whatever else, with them.  Encourage them to interact with the
locals.  I don't think it would be necessary to make any deals
with the locals.  They are smart enough, wherever you go!  You
need to actively market your god, until a critical mass of happy
devotees, has been reached.  A critical mass is reached, when
there are more people talking of their wishes coming true, than
there are people who are still waiting for their wishes to come
true.  This should be too hard given that, religious people tend
to believe that whatever happens, happens for the best and god has
better plans for them, than their own.  Slowly, you could coax one
of the better writers (who is also religious?) into writing a book
or two about your temple.  A couple of years after selling your
book, you should try and encourage one of the big TV houses to
make a teleserial based on the book, and that would be it!  Now,
you can sit back and relax.

While getting all of the above right is important, it is also
super important to work out things with the current priest, form a
temple trust, and manage other such things and to time all of it
perfectly.  This part of the plan is left as an exercise for the
reader.

On the whole, this is a much more fruitful exercise than setting
up a restaurant, since this helps a whole economy grow around the
temple.  A whole bunch of things crop up, near our small town.
Transportation grows by leaps and bounds, hospitals and schools
grow with the population, the local vendors start earning more and
get a better quality of life, and all that jazz.  I guess, you get
the drift.

Pankaj and I were stuck with this weird bug recently.  We had
a class =A= and a subclass =B= and an instance of B, b, was
returning False for =isinstance(b, A)=.

After some debugging, we found that it was a problem with
imports, and the same module was being imported twice, using
two different names -- =bar= and =baz.bar=.

Here's a cooked-up example to demonstrate the "bug".  We
create a package baz, as shown below.


#+CAPTION: package_structure

  $ tree baz

  ├── bar.py
  ├── foo.py

module.

#+CAPTION: bar.py
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  class A(object):
      pass

  class B(A):
      pass
#+END_SRC

We run =foo.py= and scratch our heads for a while, before
figuring out what's wrong...

#+CAPTION: foo.py
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :dir /tmp/baz
  # We add the directory containing out package 'baz' to sys.path to be

  # We import A from bar module present in the same directory as foo
  from bar import A
  # We import B from bar, but refer to it, as a submodule of baz
  from baz.bar import B

  a = A()
  b = B()

  print "isinstance(b, A) -->", isinstance(b, A)

  for cls in (A, B):
      print "%s -->" %cls, cls

  for module in sys.modules:
      if 'bar' in module:

If you aren't already aware of it, I'm one of those people who
goes around saying, "GitHub is my Facebook".  I spend quite a lot
of time on GitHub, browsing the work of various people, looking at
loads of interesting stuff that people built.  I keep jumping
between people pages and projects using the Watchers/Watching &
Followers/Following pages.  This way, I do come across interesting
people and projects, but the SNR is too low.  I wanted a better
way to be able to see stuff, that I find interesting.  That's how
the idea for this Chromium app -- GitHub Cue -- was born.

@baali and I hacked on this, during the last few days and got it
working.  It works as follows, (from the README) ---

1. Scrapes all the descriptions of the repositories being watched
   by the user.
2. Key terms are extracted from this description text using the
   Yahoo Term Extractor.
3. A list of languages is obtained, based on the languages of the
   repositories, the user if watching.
4. GitHub searches are performed for a combination of 3 randomly
   chosen languages and 5 random key terms.
5. 10 random repositories out of all these, are shown.


This is a very simplistic algorithm, but works decently for my
purposes.  Ideally, I would've liked to use a Collaborative
Filtering algorithm, but I found the data to be too sparse, and
the amount of computation to be too much to be done on the fly.  I
wasn't really interested in pre-computing stuff and putting it

Well, I'm not sure if it's worth writing about.  I conducted my
first org-mode workshop along with Prof. Venkatesh Choppella at
IIIT-Hyderabad.  It was a 3 hour demo+talk kind of a thing, with a
small audience of about 20 people, most of whom were new to
Emacs.

We covered almost all the aspects of Org-mode after giving a brief
introduction to Emacs.  Outlining and note-taking part was simple
and easy to understand, but the audience couldn't really
appreciate the part of keeping TODO lists and agendas and other
stuff.  I'm hoping, the reason was not me taking over from
Venkatesh.

I think the workshop should've been more hands-on and we should've
asked people to try out stuff on the spot, instead of showing off
the things possible with Emacs.  They probably would've
appreciated a few things better, that way.

Hopefully, we will be doing more workshops on Org-mode and there
are surely somethings to take away from this one.  I hope at least
one of the participants, gets hooked to Org-mode.

The talk outline is here.

** Why this article?

  I teach (Science and Engineering) students and teachers to use Python for
  their computational tasks.  I'm occasionally asked this question or something
  similar.  I remember, it was not too long ago, that I asked this question
  very often.  I asked anybody who was more experienced than me, "How do I
  start contributing (code) to FOSS?" and all the answers I got, were very
  similar.  Also, my answer is not going to be radically different.  But, I
  would still like to answer this question, because -


  1. All the answers I got, were from big-time, experienced contributors.  I
     suspect, they only vaguely remember how it feels to be just starting off.
     But, I am just starting off and I think my answer brings a slightly
     different perspective that would help others[fn:india].
  2. This piece of writing is meant to be one comprehensive compilation of
     things I want to share, if and when I'm asked this question in the
     future[fn:gsoc].
  3. More than anything else, a reminder and reference for myself.  I still
     have a long way to go.  I only have a handful of contributions against my
     name (none of them earth shattering).  I haven't (yet) done my 10,000
     hours of programming nor have I learned anything like half a dozen
     programming languages.[fn:norvig]

  Thanks to baali, Ringo and Voodoo for reading drafts of this article and
  giving some very valuable feedback to improve it.

** What should I do?
  I know how exciting the FOSS world seems, the first time we discover it.  You
  are dying to contribute.  You want to contribute, Right Now!  But you've no
  clue, what, where and how.  Relax.  Give yourself time.  You've a lifetime
  ahead of you.  Explore.  Explore, even more.  Play with things, Try out
  stuff, Break stuff, Spill things all over the place.  Have fun![fn:github]

  Given that you are reading this, I presume that, you do have access to the
  Internet.  But, if you don't, it could turn an impediment to your goal.  Easy
  access to a decent internet connection is a prerequisite.

  Learn a programming language, well[fn:norvig].  By learning, I don't mean
  getting familiar with the syntax or passing a bunch of exams.  Get familiar
  with the paradigms of the language.  Learn to think in that language.  Write
  code that does something *real*, instead of doing toy examples.[fn:bot] Also,
  it helps know bits and pieces about the history and evolution of the
  language.  This will give you a sense of why some features are present (or
  absent) and will help you program better, in that language[fn:python].

  Some projects will definitely catch your eye, while you are exploring.  Start
  using the ones that you need.  Follow them!

  Start with using the bleeding edge [fn:vcs] software.  Bleeding edge refers
  to the latest sources of the project, where the active development is going
  on.  Given the continuous nature of software development, using the latest
  source,

  1. prevents you from wasting time on fixing bugs that have already been fixed
     and
  2. lets you look at the latest changes being made and contribute effectively
     and easily

  Also, start following the project's mailing lists -- both the dev and the
  user lists, if they are separate.  The user-list discussions will help you
  discover functionality and possibly give you some chance to peek at the
  source code, too.  Don't be surprised or worried if you don't follow most of
  what goes on, in the dev-list.  Be patient and keep at it.  You will learn a
  lot about the /what, why and how/ of the project.  Also don't be afraid to
  look foolish there!  There wouldn't be one developer who doesn't have some
  embarrassing logs of stuff she said in public, in her initial days.

  Slowly you'll start to learn the dynamics of the community -- how things
  function, the DOs and DON'Ts, etc [fn:people].  Also, there's a good chance
  that the project has an active IRC channel.  If it does, hanging out there
  will give you more insights.  Contributing to the documentation, is often a
  useful step before contributing code.  Cleaning up the documentation or
  writing documentation, often requires you to read the code and helps you
  understand it better.

  Next, start *acting* on Bug reports (or tiny feature requests).  Start with
  trying to reproduce the bugs and sending confirmations.  Gradually, start
  looking at the source and trying to figure out where the problem is.  Be
  patient, with this [fn:patience] .  Once you get comfortable with the code
  and the coding style, start sending code snippets and comments, explaining
  what you think might be the problem.  One fine day, you will be able to send
  a full working patch!  But, before that don't hesitate to send partial fixes.
  You can learn a lot from the comments of the devs and looking at how they
  finally fixed it.  Also, IRC could be a good place to ask for help, if you
  are stuck and are looking for some quick help, so you can move further.

  In all of this, it helps if you have one (or a bunch of) favorite /area(s)/
  or /module(s)/ of the project, specially in a big project.  You should pounce
  upon any issues in your favorite area.

  Participate in sprints.  It's not uncommon for projects to have regular
  sprints.  Make it there [fn:scipy]!  Also, a couple of developers may decide
  to meet up on a weekend and hack.  If it's happening in your neighborhood,
  ask if you can join.  Don't be surprised, if they shout out a big YES!  You
  will definitely learn a lot, when there is help so close-by.

  A /shortcut/ would be to start your own project!  It is easier (in some ways)
  to release your own code under a FOSS license, than contribute to some of the
  existing projects.  You don't have to have your code approved by the project
  leads, you don't need to mould your code to fit the standards of the project,
  you don't have to read and understand all the (relevant parts of the)
  existing code, etc.  But all of this, definitely teaches you a lot.

  As a beginner, I think it is important to solve your *own* problems, problems
  that you care about (at least at that point in time).  Most of the projects,
  started off with their developers wanting to solve their own problems.  Only,
  incidentally, they solved some of the World's problems, too!

  Start small, though.  Don't start off with a project that aims to replace
  Chrome or Firefox as the best browser, or an editor to replace Vim or Emacs.
  Writing extensions to your favorite software could be a good place to start,
  for instance an Emacs minor/major mode[fn:o2b], a Chrome
  extension[fn:gethub], etc.  Stand on the shoulders of giants!

  Also, take this as an opportunity to gain some of the skills that would be
  useful, when you want to start contributing to others projects.

  1. Learn to use Version Control (Git + GitHub is awesome!)
  2. Learn to use build and setup tools.
  3. Learn about packaging and distributing your software.
  4. Learn how to license your code.
  5. Learn to Collaborate!

  All of this, I hope, would suffice to get your first contribution in.  But,
  there are a few things that will help you in the long run.

  Good English. Specially written communication, since that is how you would be
  communicating, more often than not.  Fair or not, hackers are known to be
  very particular about good communication.  I'm not exaggerating when I say,
  what you say may be ignored even if it makes perfect sense, if you said it in
  sloppy English.

  Using a *nix would put you in some great company.  At the very least, you
  save time when looking for solutions to known problems.  Using a good editor
  and learning to type quickly can be big productivity gains.  You only get 24
  hours a day!

  An understanding of licensing issues, can come in handy, many a times.

  Happy Hacking!


[fn:gsoc] All of this is generic advice, but students applying to programs like
GSoC, may find it useful.

[fn:india] I'm writing in the Indian context.

[fn:vcs] You may have to learn to use a version control system; at the very
least cloning and pulling updates.

[fn:python] I recommend Python, but I am definitely biased.  Any language that
is generic enough would do, really.
  1. It gets you off the blocks, very quickly.
  2. It is easy to learn.
  3. It is batteries included. Read as, comes bundled with a huge bunch of
     libraries.
  4. It is general purpose enough. Read as, it has libraries that let you do
     anything, you'd possibly want to do.
  5. There's a lot of Python code around, that you can read andlearn from.

[fn:norvig] Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years by Peter Norvig.

[fn:github] Getting yourself a GitHub account and /socializing/ there is a lot
of fun and helps quite a bit.  GitHub is my Facebook!

[fn:bot] I started learning Python from /the Python tutorial/ and some other
sources and doing the examples in them.  It was good, but I think I started
learning more, and better, when I started solving problems from Project Euler.
And writing an IRC bot in Python, taught me a lot more than all of this.

[fn:people] Org-mode is the only project that I really contribute to, actively.
I *really* liked the way the community gels together and the kind of people on
the list.  There are some really knowledgeable, friendly and helpful people.
It feels great to be a part of the community.

[fn:scipy] A few months ago, I was part of a sprint on the numpy-scipy
eco-system.  We had somewhere around 50 patches (a lot of them were
documentation fixes) submitted to all the projects!  Most of the people were
submitting their first patch and I think it was a great opportunity for them to
start.  [I should try and get back to them.]

[fn:o2b] Org-mode is really awesome, and I use it for everything I write.  Blog
posts are a big part of what I write, and so, I wanted to write them in
orgmode.  And so, org2blog was born.

[fn:gethub] I recently wrote a Chrome extension, thanks to a friend's idea.
Inspired by Gmail notifications, a GitHub addict wanted notifications for
activity in GitHub.

[fn:patience] There have been instances, where it took me half a day to fix
something, that would've been fixed in about an hour by someone more
comfortable with the code.  But, I think everybody goes through this stage.
This is how you learn.

Over the last two days, I hacked up my first Chrome extension.
I've been using Chrome only for the past couple of weeks or so and
I begin to like it, though some of the extensions aren't as mature
as I would've liked.

The original idea was floated by my friend,  Madhu, and Lee helped
me quite a bit, while I was working on it.

** What does it do?

  It is a simple extension, that shows pop-ups, whenever there is
  an update in your GitHub "Wall" (yes, this is a Facebook world)
  or News Feed as they call it.

  After installation, you will need to save your =username= and
  =token= for the extension to work.

** Where to get it?

  Presently, you will need to get it from GitHub.

  I might add it to the Chrome Web Store, once I see more people
  using it.  I couldn't justify, to myself, paying the initial
  one-time verification fee that Google asks for.

  *UPDATE*: [2011-03-04 Fri] Added GetHub to the store

** Comments and Feedback

    new inline help for many of GitHub Wiki's supported markup
    languages.

    The language definitions the editor uses are JSON-based and easy
    to edit. If you'd like us to support a markup language that we
    don't currently support, Gollum, GitHub's wiki software, is
    entirely open source -- fork our code and send us a pull request

Well, as you can see, I've changed my blog a bit.  I had been
trying to make it gel well with org-mode and looking for ways to
allow me to share arbit stuff with separate feeds for tags,
separate pages with independent feeds, etc.

I finally got around to tweaking the code of reprise to be able to
do this.  There are still a few things I would like to change, but
I'll make the changes gradually.  The looks are also straight from
uddegal's [[reprise, with a few tiny tweaks.  I hope it is alright
to be using it.  I really liked the theme.

Every tag now has a separate feed. =/tags/emacs.atom= will give
you the feed of =emacs= for instance. Also, I plan to have a
couple of more pages, one for all the interesting links I come
across and another for interesting quotes.  Both of these pages,
have their own feeds too (=quotes.atom= and =links.atom=).

In the spirit of minimalism, I got rid of comments.  I've been
looking for ways of having comments without all the javascript
cruft from disqus, but I didn't find any satisfactory way to do
this.  So, the site will have no comments.  You can write to me,
in case you've something to say to me.

Well, frankly quite a few people seem to be using it, and I

Actually, this post is to announce a change in the namespace of
*my* org2blog.  It turns out that there is another package that is
called org2blog, but it posts to blogger.  Tehom, the author of
the other package got in touch with me, and we tried to clean up a
few things.  In this process, we decided to use two different
namespaces, to avoid conflicts if a particular user has both the
packages loaded.  I am going to use =org2blog/wp= as my namespace
prefix, instead of the older =org2blog=.  So, if you are posting a
sub-tree, you'll need to use the =org2blog/wp-post-subtree=
function, instead of =org2blog-post-subtree=.

We, Tehom and I, did discuss the possibility of merging the two
packages into a single huge package, but we think the amount of
work is far greater than the payoffs.  So, the packages continue
to be called =org2blog= but we reference each others packages, to
reduce the confusion, amongst users.

=org2blog/wp= version 0.4 comes with the new namespace.

But, the org markup itself is such a cool thing.  I've been
looking at =rst= all day, and it's such a pain to find out where
your headings are, what level your current sub-heading is at, etc.
(I'll probably do a bit better, with some getting used to. I'm an

to find out, with just one quick look!  I don't think any other

A note to self, but may benefit someone facing a similar problem.

- *Problem* :: SSH-ing to our server was working well.  But, file
               transfers like =scp=, =git push= were failing.

- *Diagnosis* :: I had been thinking it was a problem with our
                 campus network on the first night and was too
                 sleepy to try and fix it.  But things didn't
                 improve even after one full day.  Then I asked a
                 friend of mine, and he confirmed that he has been
                 facing the same problem for a couple of days.  I
                 then tried file transfers to another server and
                 it was working fine.  Then I tried file transfers
                 between the two servers and even that worked fine!

- *Solution* :: After some googling, I figured that the problem
                was with a machine between me and the server.
                Changing the =mtu= to 1492 from 1500 on the

Pandoc is a haskell library and a command line tool, that can
convert markup from one to another and it does it pretty well.
Until now it supported quite a few markups, but not orgmode.  But
now, Orgmode support has been added! Yay!

But, it can only read from other formats and write to org-mode
format.  The other way around, is not possible, but you can do
that straight from org-mode, right?

I've often felt the need for an org-importer and hence decided to
do something about it.  I stumbled upon Pandoc, when I was moving
my blog, and found it pretty neat.  After, yet another request for
an importer, on the org-mode mailing list, I decided to look at
Pandoc.  I was somehow under the impression that it was written in
Python.  But it turned out, I had to learn Haskell!  A good excuse
to learn a new language, eh?  I brushed through a tutorial for a
couple of days (and was blown off by the paradigm of the language)
and was able to port the RST writer in Pandoc, to an Org

This is some fun I had, trying to replicate what was written in
this post. I had been trying to understand what was happening
here, and found this post on Hacker News very helpful.

It is a known fact that our eyes have more cones for green and
red as compared to blue.  The Bayer filter used for digital camera
lenses is based upon this principle.  This post tries to
illustrate that using the following two arguments.
- Looking at only the blue channel of an image looks very dark.
- Tripling the pixel size of blue channel doesn't cause much
  distortion in the final image.
Hence, our eyes suck at blue.

Their argument is flawed, but we could try and improve a few
things.

** Looking at the blue channel.
  This is definitely flawed, since the intensity of blue in the
  image they have taken may be less and hence giving us a false
  positive.

  We could instead gray-scale the image and use these pixel values
  in the 3 channels and look at the images.

  This also eliminates the problem of the image being captured
  through a Bayer filter.

  Here's some =python= code to do the same. (uses =matplotlib=)
  #+begin_src python
    def show_channels(I):
        for i in range(3):
            J = zeros_like(I)
            J[:, :, i] = I[:, :, i]
            figure(i)
            imshow(J)

    def show_grey_channels(I):
        K = average(I, axis=2)
        for i in range(3):
            J = zeros_like(I)
            J[:, :, i] = K
            figure(i+10)

** Pixelating the blue channel

  Again, there was this argument of use of Bayer filter affecting
  the image and the like.

  What I did was to swap the channels, and then look at the
  images. However I swapped the channels, the image where the
  green channel was pixelated always looked the worst.  The
  difference between blue and red was less noticeable, I feel.

  Here's the code.

  #+begin_src python
    def zoom(x, factor=2):
        rows, cols = x.shape
        row_stride, col_stride = x.strides
        view = np.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided(x,
                            (rows, factor, cols, factor),
                            (row_stride, 0, col_stride, 0))
        return view.reshape((rows*factor, cols*factor))

    def subsample(I):
        for i in range(3):
            J = I.copy()
            J[:, :, i] = zoom(I[::4, ::4, i], 4)
            figure(i)
            title("%s channel subsampled" %colors[i])
            imshow(J)

    def swap_subsample(I, k=1):
        for c, color in enumerate(colors):
            print "%s <-- %s" %(colors[c], colors[(c+k)%3])
        for i in range(3):
            J = zeros_like(I)
            for j in range(3):
                J[:, :, j] = I[:, :, (j+k)%3]
            J[:, :, i] = zoom(I[::4, ::4, (i+k)%3], 4)
            figure(i+10)
            title("%s channel subsampled" %colors[i])

I posted a snippet [fn:pysnip] of python code that used xdotool to
raise windows.  I got one patch from dusual [fn:dusual] that
enabled raising of windows in the current workspace only.

More importantly, Jordan gave a one-liner [fn:one-liner] in bash,
that could do the same thing as my long and elaborate python
snippet.  I had a feeling that this would be much shorter in bash,
but I don't feel comfortable writing bash scripts. :P

Below is a bash snippet that tries to incorporates both the
changes. :)

#+begin_src sh :export code
  found=0

  for win in `xdotool search --class $1`;
  do
  if [ `xdotool get_desktop_for_window $win` -eq `xdotool get_desktop` ];
  then found=1; break;
  fi;
  done

  if [ $found -eq 1 ]; then xdotool windowactivate $win; else $1; fi
#+end_src

*Note*: When you've visual effects enabled (the default option on
Ubuntu), getting the current desktop/workspace doesn't work,
probably because Root Window properties are being messed around by
it.

*Note2*: =search= takes an option =--screen=. It'd be nice if it
 also had an option =--desktop=.  This task could then be done in
 a one-liner.

  We have the technology. The world is truly flat.  We have the
  resources, to be able to fulfil all the basic needs of all the
  people and the potential of the country.

  We lack are institutions, right kind of politics. They take a
  lot of nurturing.  Let us be engaged. It is our future that's on
  the line. Economic growth is spurring changes in the
  country. Communications revolution is helping bring change.  The
  question is, What direction of change?  I ask of you, to make a
  difference to the way the Indian political trajectory takes

Hello World!

My first post at my new home.  Obviously, it was going to be about the
move.  You knew it, didn't you? ;)

Well, I got some space on the web, along with a few friends.  Thanks to
my org-mode fanboyism, I now use it to maintain my homepage.  I've
successfully completed import of my Wordpress posts and comments. :)

** I now use

  - Emacs and Org-mode [fn:orgmode] to write my posts.
  - =org-hyde.el= [fn:orghyde] to publish =html= in a =hyde=
    parse-able format.
  - =hyde= [fn:hyde] to convert the =html= pages into a blog.
  - =org-publish= to publish other pages in my home page.
  - =git= [fn:git] and a =bash= script for publishing.
  - Disqus [fn:disqus] for the comment system.


  Yes, I know it sounds rather complicated. :) But, now that I
  have it set up, it's not all that difficult to make a post.
  It's just a matter of one =git commit= and =push=.  I need to
  fine-tune the shell script a bit, though.

** How I moved

  The move definitely wasn't trivial.  I guess, I could've started
  afresh but, what fun would that have been? ;)

  This roughly how I did things -- in the order that I did them.

*** Choosing =hyde=

    I looked at a handful of options to maintain a blog, using
    org-mode --- =blorg=, =org-jekyll=, =blorgit=, =ikiwiki=.
    After some assessment, I decided upon =org-jekyll= and
    =jekyll=.  But then, I accidentally stumbled upon =hyde=.

    I decided to go with =hyde= instead of =jekyll= [fn:jekyll]
    since

    1) It's in Python.  I didn't want to start figuring out Ruby,
       now.
    2) It uses Django templates [fn:dj-tmpl].  And Django is
       something, I wish to learn.  I've started with that. :)

*** Clean up =org-jekyll= to work with =hyde=.

    I then "ported" =org-jekyll.el= into =org-hyde.el=.

    - removed stuff like categories and languages, that I was not
      going to use.
    - Added some code w.r.t timestamps, from org2blog, to it, so
      that my older =org2blog= posts could be easily ported.

*** Clean up older org2blog posts

    =org2blog= can post either buffers or subtrees.  I had posts in
    both formats.  I converted all of them into subtrees of one
    tree, using some Python.

*** Import older posts

    This was the most painful posts.  Importing all the old posts
    from Wordpress.  =org-mode= really needs a XHTML/XML importer!

    I did all sorts of crazy stuff to get this done.

    - used pandoc to convert html to =markdown=
    - wrote some throw away regex code to convert =markdown= to
      =org-mode=.
    - wrote more regex code to convert =html= to =org-mode=.
    - hacked up a lot of stuff and finally got all the posts into
      =org= format! :)


*** A workflow for publishing

    Set up =git= along with some =bash= code, to have a mechanism
    to minimize the effort in making a blog post.  All this is
    still a lot of work, compared to the ease with which I used to
    use =org2blog=.  That's partly due to =ssh= restrictions in my
    hostel.

*** CSS clean-up

    I'm using the same CSS for =org-mode= published files and
    =hyde= published files. I had to clean up my =hyde= templates
    and the CSS to make both of them look similar.

    My first tryst with CSS hasn't been all that bad. :)

*** Installing disqus and importing comments

    Using disqus was one thing, I wasn't sure I wanted to do.  I
    would've loved it if comments could be managed with org-mode
    too. ;) [fn:comments]

    Anyway, I finally decided to go with it, and I'm quite happy
    with it. :)

    I loved the ease with which comments could be imported.

    1) Import Wordpress comments using the export =xml= file.
    2) Generate a CSV file containing the URL map -- mapping the
       newer urls to the older ones.
    3) Upload the CSV file and tada!

** Conclusion
  I got to learn quite a few things, during all of this.  I also
  have some bits of code, that I can share with you, in case you
  are interested.  Leave a comment, if you wish. :)

  I'm just hoping to reduce the additional steps required in
  publishing to ensure it doesn't add to my already erratic
  blogging habits.

If you are new to =Python=, you should probably stop reading here.
But, if you have used =Python= and =numpy=, then read on. Before, that
try these bits of code.

#+begin_src python :results output
import numpy
a = numpy.array([1,2])
a = a + 0.5j
print a
#+end_src

The "same thing", in a slightly different way.

#+begin_src python :results output
import numpy
a = numpy.array([1,2])
a += 0.5j
print a
#+end_src

Both the code blocks, look really the same, until you look carefully.
Under normal circumstances ~a = a + b~ and ~a += b~ behave exactly
similarly, and we really don't need to bother about the differences
between them.

But, ~+=~, which is an augmented assignment operator, actually tries
to perform the operation in-place, unlike the other statement where
=+= actually returns a new object which is again being referenced by
the name =a=.

But, when dealing with =numpy= arrays, this will lead to trouble.
When assigning to an array, it's =dtype= is not changed and hence the
trouble.

The right way to use the augmented assignment operator, would be:

#+begin_src python :results output
import numpy
a = numpy.array([1,2], dtype=complex)
a += 0.5j
print a
#+end_src

The same thing is explained in this thread.  Also, Thanks to
Bhanukiran for asking me this.

  <BerntH> hi punchagan   [18:36]

  <punchagan> BerntH: ever used/tried blorg or blorgit?  [18:47]

  <punchagan> I like the way org-publish works, but blorg exports one org file as a blog. If blorg were to be re-written on top of org-publish, how should it be done? use one file per post or just one file for the whole blog?  [18:52]

  <bremner> punchagan: another option is to use ikiwiki and use the org-mode plugin to render pages. This is what i do, although only a bit of the site is in org.  [19:44]

  <punchagan> bremner: can I have a look at your site?  [19:45]

  <bremner> sure, it ain't pretty, but: www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner  [19:46]

  <punchagan> thanks. I'll keep this in mind.   [19:47]

  <punchagan> I just loved the way this site looks and behaves -- http://julien.danjou.info/projects.html

  <bremner> well, the side bar at least is possible with ikiwiki. Other than that I suppose it is mainly a matter of css  [19:48]

  <BerntH> punchagan: nope  [19:49]

  <punchagan> ok BerntH  [19:50]

This post is by Dominick Mills, coming to us, thanks to
Bloggerstock.  Dominick aka Lije blogs at Lije's Mindstate.  My post
on this month's Bloggerstock topic will appear at That Ain't Kosher.

And here is Dominick's post for you
---------

Hello world..today I'll be talking about a period in time I would like
to do-over, however I couldn't think of anything so I went in another
direction....I'd like to thank Bloggerstock and punchagan for
the opportunity leak my thoughts on this page....

I hope the readers understand that my views does not reflect those of
the host's page..before I get started though Let me take the time out
to explain what Bloggerstock is all about.  Bloggerstock is the
brainchild of a small group of bloggers who connected on 20SB. The
idea comes from the concept of a blog-swap in that maybe we could
create our own kind of event where we all wrote posts to be posted on
the next person’s blog. Essentially forming a blog-ring.

There's a lot of things in life everyone would like to relive and do
differently..I've been giving it some thought and it's been racking my
brain for the whole month now...I came to the conclusion that I have
nothing I'd like to really do-over...

My reason for this is that I wouldn't be this person I am...and I
wouldn't alter it in anyway...I love what I've become...if it weren't
for all the good and bad that occurred during my life time..I wouldn't
even be here writing this....or I wouldn't even have the same goals
and all my aspirations would be small...I know this all sounds weird
but giving the fact that I am a weird person, those who know me, this
is expected...I believe in things happening for a reason and without
these occurrences we'd be something totally different, and

maybe not becoming what we're suppose to be in life...sometimes we
look at situations and think, " Just maybe if I had done this... or
maybe if I hadn't..." even if my decisions had made into a bum on the
streets I think I would feel the same way...truth is we all have
regrets..learning to live with them is the hardest thing to do..we
tend to get caught up in the moment and want to relive those
things..either for the good or the bad...but we fail to realize that
it is those things that build character not for today but for our
tomorrows.

Whether it's falling for the wrong person, being back stabbed from a
friend, getting hoodwinked from a stranger, or missing out on an
opportunity....all of these are just life's lessons being taught..with
that being said you should never sulk over a decision we've made...in
the end we're our own cause of grief or happiness so don't whine about
it stuff that's happened....accept what has happened and move
forward...don't hold on to them, but don't forget them either...these
are turning points in our lives so appreciate them..

Well that's all I have to conjure up on the matter..though it kind of
went against the topic a bit but hey am stubborn lol.. once again I'd
like to thank punchagan for allowing me to feature on Rustic
Reverie and also Bloggerstock for providing me with the opportunity to
express myself on a fellow blogger's page.. here's a link to my page
to view my featured blog post

Just back after attending PyCon India '10. It was not as exciting
as I hoped it would be.  That's generally the case with any
conference I attend.  (I guess, I expect too much from them. :P)

The keynote by David Goodger (pronounced like Badger :) was
"Good".  It was a very simple one talking of how to get Python
into the workplace.  His simple recommendation was to use Python
if we saw any opportunity where it could be used, without
bothering about permissions, convincing people etc.  "It's better
to ask for forgiveness, than for permission."  He spoke of myths
around Python -- scripting language, dynamic language, too much
white space, toy language, nobody uses it.  He concluded the talk,
by saying mentioning Indian driving to be an indication of some
quick reflexes that we Indians have. ;) On the whole it was an
enlightening, humorous and enjoyable talk.

I didn't attend too many of other talks.  Amongst the ones that I
did attend, I particularly liked the one by Asim Mittal on using
the Nintendo Wii with Python.

On some thought about my experiences at conferences, I think
conferences shouldn't have any talks at all.  Or atleast, I
shouldn't be attending conferences for talks.  They are an excuse
to catch-up with people.  Conferences should have only lightning
talks of 10 mins and sprints.  Talks, with an extensive
explanation of stuff that can be easily found on the web, are a
waste of time.

Should one take the easy route of asking someone who knows, if she

before asking her? Should one value his time more than others' or

Would we learn more if we tried to find out ourselves? Does
learning more, make sense? Is it worth spending the extra time?

We, Ritesh and I, finished our first 100+km ride -- approximately
110km. Yo!

** The Route map

    IIT-Bombay to Karnala Bird Sanctuary, and back.

*** Up

*** Down

** The Story
    We started at around 0720 and were hoping to reach Karnala Bird
    Sanctuary by around 1130.  We --- actually, soot covered clones of
    us ---  reached by about 1215 or so.  That's pretty decent,
    considering we were directed to Karnala sports complex, when we were
    looking for bird sanctuary and there was quite a bit of traffic near
    Panvel.

    While we were getting tickets to get into the sanctuary, a man was
    amused by Ritesh's polka (dirt) dotted shirt and asks us whether we
    rode down from JNPT.  We got all excited and told him, that we rode
    down from Powai!  He just said, "Gone Mad!" and walked away, as if
    madness was contagious.  Both of us, felt great!  We were high!  It
    felt like the best compliment to get after a long, tiring,
    (blackening) ride.  We got in and rushed to a tap and almost had a
    bath under it.  The first touch of cold water was heaven!  Just a
    while later, we got a shock.  We couldn't get any food near/inside
    the sanctuary.  We will have to go back 3 km for that.  We spent
    about an hour and a half, getting some oxygen, looking for a few
    birds, giving up and settling with spiders and clicking some
    pictures.  We got went back 3km to the hotel and spent about an hour
    there (not all of it eating ;). We started back at around 1515.

    The ride back was eventful.  We took a slightly different route,
    tempted by a free Highway(NH4), waiting to be rode on.  The road
    looked awesome, with a hill on the left, and no vehicles in sight.
    But, as fate would have it, Ritesh's rear tyre gave way.  After some
    search we found a guy fixing tyres of vehicles on the highway.  But
    he refused to fix our bicycle.  He refused even to fill air in it,
    so we could reach the nearest cycle repair shop.  After more search,
    we found who agreed to fill air in the tyre. (It needs a special
    valve pin.  The previous guy, probably didn't have it. But we
    could've hacked up something.)

    We rushed to Kalamboli and got the tyre fixed.  Then we headed back
    in the route that we had come on.  It'd been raining on and off
    through out the morning.  But first rain on the return only started
    near Nerul.  It was a great relief.  My cycle started moving more
    smoothly...  I loved it.  We got lost a bit near Ghatkopar.  Also,
    the traffic was quite bad there. (Why do drivers get so bad, once it
    starts raining?  It's not unique to Mumbai, but quite visible here.
    We were back in Campus by around 2040.

    Ritesh was energized after the puncture was fixed.  He rode like
    crazy, after that.  The sole of my feet started hurting ---
    something like a cramp.  I don't know what exactly happened.  Also,
    my groin was hurting quite a bit.  My only motivation at that point
    was seeing Ritesh ride like crazy.  He was at his best, then!  I'm
    still wondering where he got all that energy from.  It was a great
    ride, for both of us!  Motivating each other to keep going. :)

    Ritesh, where to next?

** Some lessons for future
    + The Cycle needs to be as close to perfect, as it possibly can be.
    + Carry your route map along. Enquiring the route a colossal waste
      of time and sometimes unreliable, too.
    + A pollution mask is a *must* for Mumbai (or any other city.)
    + Carry enough water and food. (We drank about 7L of water between us)
    + Need to learn how to fix punctures.  Need a tool kit.
    + A helmet, shorts with padding would be good.
    + An odometer would be useful too.
    + Learn to use the hand-pump or carry along a normal pump.
    + I should probably ride along with some Cycling group for the
      experience of it. I'll get to learn a lot of things.

** Photos
    Photos will come soon, hopefully.

It's just a co-incidence that this post is coming on
Independence day.

Last night I was in an auto with a couple of friends, and the
auto couldn't get up a slope and stopped near the edge of the
slope which was leading onto a main road. We had to get down
from the auto, and after a lot of fight, the auto got on top.
As the driver was trying hard to get the auto moving, a guy
comes over and starts talking to him in Marathi. I'm not sure
if he was a traffic police. He was dressed in white, but
didn't really look like one.

After asking a few questions, but not getting any replies, the
guy asks him in Hindi, if he understands Marathi, and on
getting a negative reply, starts shouting on him!

The guy harasses the driver, asking him to handover his
license and threatens him of horrible consequences, if he
doesn't do so. We tried to intervene saying, we want to leave
early and stuff, but the auto refused to start. The driver
asked us to leave and said he'll take care of the matter.

And then, today I hear people talking of national integration
and stuff. I hear stuff about changing the country, getting
rid of corrupt politicians and all the high ideals crap. I
keep hearing all sorts of patriotic songs that I hear only
twice a year. Not once more than that.

Why is it that we talk of all this only on these two days of
National importance? Why are these songs played only twice a
year? Don't we get that feeling of patriotism on other days?
Isn't patriotism a "true" feeling?

I think, India will only take a leap in it's progress, when
that happens.

Drafting behind trucks (when cycling) could be a great energy

The idea is similar to birds flying in a V-shape to get a greater

Pacelines in cycling races are formed precisely for this reason.
This page has a short summary of what drafting is all about.

Below is a mail sent by Eric Schulte to the org-mode mailing list
answering a query on how to write elisp for org-mode. I am
reproducing it here, since it is useful advice for me. The actual
thread is [[http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/27579][here]].

-------------------------------------------------------------
The way that I learned how to program in emacs lisp was mainly
using two commands `elisp-index-search' bound to `C-h e' on my
system, and most importantly `describe-function' bound to `C-h f'.
With `describe-function' you can look at the source code of
functions whose behavior you are familiar with, you can then copy
portions of the code to your *scratch* buffer where they can be
edited and evaluated with `eval-defun' bound to `C-M-x'.  Now with
Babel, instead of doing this in the scratch buffer you could do
this in emacs-lisp code blocks in an org file, enabling notes and
hierarchical organization -- it can be nice to have your noodling
all collected in one file for later reference.

If you are going to do any serious work with lisp, I would
emphatically recommend using paredit-mode, and becoming friends
with the Sexp movement functions

C-M-f	runs the command paredit-forward
C-M-b	runs the command paredit-backward
C-M-u	runs the command backward-up-list
C-M-k	runs the command kill-sexp
C-y	runs the command yank

They allow you to manipulate lisp code on the level of logical
expressions, the utility of which can not be over stated.

As for working with Org-mode in particular, I'd recommend looking
at the documentation and source-code of Org-mode functions with
`describe-function', and then looking for how these functions are
actually used in the Org-mode code base with `rgrep'.

For a more structured learning experience, I've heard very good
things about http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-lisp-intro/,
although I haven't used it myself.

Hope this helps.  Happy Hacking -- Eric

The novelty of the journey was that we had a bus ride from Adavali

At work, we use hg and to be frank, I haven't really got the
hang of using it well. I've recently started using git for my own
work and I'm loving it.

I chose git because
- github seems to be a nice place to hang around, as compared to
  bit-bucket.
- org-mode uses git and I need to learn to use git, if I intend
contribute anything to org-mode.

But after using git for a month or so, I'm totally loving using
git. The way it handles merges is awesome. People go gaga over
it's speed.

But for me, it's the way it handles branches. I can have any
number of branches on my machine, while pushing only changes in
the master branch, upstream. I can easily merge changes from one
branch to another. After putting up a lot of fight, I couldn't
make hg do this. Not as well as git does it!

I've now decided to convert my personal repositories to git.

This blog post shows how to.

No.  Not the Obama change.  I'm talking of change as in small

it.  There's always a problem with getting it.  I'm often worried
before getting into a bus or an auto, or going to a shop whether
or not the guy would give me change for a 50, 100 or a 500.
People so reluctant to "part" with it. What are they saving it
for?

I think the situation would be much better if people readily gave
it, when required.  There would be a free flow and if not anything
more, I wouldn't have to worry about it when going somewhere.
But, I "feel" this would actually reduce the instances when both

I've often got bad service from "service providers" - hotels,
restaurants, phone services, Internet services etc. I guess that's
due to the population in India. If one customer goes back unhappy
that doesn't really make a difference, because there would be
hundred others already waiting in the queue.

You, as a, service provider would get your share of customers and
profits, no matter how bad you are. Thanks to the population.

One solution could be, to write about the bad service you got from
a provider and make people aware of it, but often there aren't
enough options, for others to choose from. Inevitably, the bad
service provider is going to get some customers. What's the way
out?

*Update [2016-06-16]* [[https://twitter.com/raamdev][Raam Dev]] pointed me to an [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/21322/preventing-org-cut-subtree-from-appending-subsequent-cuts-to-previous-kill-ring][issue]] and a suggested fix, that
 I have updated the above code with.

 For the uninitiated, vimperator is an emacs plugin to get Firefox
working with vim keybindings and firemacs [fn:firemacs] is for emacs keybindings.

I'm obsessed with emacs (as should already be evident) and can't
really edit text without it's key-bindings. There are others like me,
and hence the firemacs plugin. It's a blessing for my tribe.

Firemacs is great, except for the one great feature that it lacks -
being able to jump to links/textareas without using the mouse.  I've
seen Nishanth do it with ease, using Vimperator. I wanted to add this
feature to Firemacs, by copying some code from Vimperator to
Firemacs.  I directly started looking at the code, but couldn't make
head or tail of it. I got a few doubts about how Vimperator works,
since I'd never used it. Nishanth asked me to simply install it and
try it out.

And then we had our EUREKA! moment. Vimperator and Emacs both
enabled together work seamlessly well. Two obsessed people are happy
and satisfied! And hopefully many more. :D

[fn:firemacs] Key-bindings are a religious thing, in the world of editors!

After a trek, I had an interesting conversation with Ritesh, about
taking pictures during a trip. He said, he started to realize that
when he's lost in the cycle of click, see, analyze, click,
... when he's got a cam in his hand. He didn't have a cam on this
trek and thoroughly enjoyed it!

I connect to this phenomenon, as well. I think, like Ritesh says,
having separate trips for Photography makes sense. On other trips,
we could be clicking, but just for the sake of memory. Trying to
get amazing photographs shouldn't be a goal.
I should refrain from -
  1. looking at the output and adjusting repeatedly until it's
     perfect.
  2. clicking too many pictures in a given length of time.

For both of this, a film camera seems to be the solution!

What say, Ritesh?

** What is 'Sage Days'?
  Sage Days is a confluence of present and prospective SAGE Users and
  Developers. It is an opportunity to come together to share ideas,
  brainstorm and hack on Sage. Sage Days 25 is the 25th version of Sage
  Days, and is being organized in Mumbai, India. In order to cater to an
  Indian audience and scenario, this version has been tweaked
  slightly. Sage Days 25 has beginner level tutorials, in addition to
  the usual talks and sprints, to help new users get started with Sage
  and help promote the use of Sage in India.

** What is Sage?
  Sage is a free, open-source mathematics software system licensed under
  the GPL. It combines the power of numerous existing open-source
  packages into a common Python-based interface. It's mission is to
  create a "viable free open source alternative to Magma, Maple,
  Mathematica and Matlab". Sage has tools for a broad range of
  mathematical areas like Linear Algebra, Calculus, Symbolic Math,
  Plotting, Rings & Groups, Graph Theory, Number Theory and
  Cryptography. Essentially, "it can do anything from mapping a
  12-dimensional object to calculating rainfall patterns under global
  warming" - as Science Daily puts it . Eager to get started? Start
  here. Apart from being feature rich, it's usability is one of it's
  greatest strengths. Sage Notebook, a web-interface for all the math
  you'll ever want to do, is really the killer feature! As the Sage
  Marketing page says, "The SAGE GUI surely works on your computer box,
  because it just runs in Firefox!". Try it Now!

** Why should you attend?
  Sage Days 25 is being attended by the creator and lead developer of
  Sage, Prof. William Stein. It will also be attended by other
  developers of Sage. This would be a great opportunity to meet and
  interact with them! The conference will be attended by a plethora of
  enthusiastic people from all over the country who use Sage or are
  interested in doing so. The conference will also see the presence of
  many mathematicians interested in software. Who knows, you may run
  into someone you'd want to collaborate with, for your future work!
  This event will be a great learning experience, if you are even
  remotely interested in math and software for it!

+I'd+ We had been on a 60 km long trip today. My second one, and
Ritesh's first. The map of our route is here. On the whole the ride
was wonderful! A thoroughly enjoyable one. It was near perfect, with
it raining only as much as we enjoyed an not anymore. :)

+ The ride on Godbander Road was the most enjoyable part of the
  ride. Simple Wonderful! That's what made the trip worth it!

+ It was more relaxed than my previous ride and it took us about 5
  hours on the whole. We must've been pedalling for about 4 hours. I
  don't have the "actual" figures.

+ Except for the stretch of Western express highway (service road)
  from Jogeshwari to a little after the Sanjay Gandhi National park's
  entrance, the road was decent. The Eastern Express highway service
  road was awesome!

+ Cycling alone is totally different from cycling with someone
  else. We didn't really go together, but we were meeting up once in a
  while. The loneliness, of rides on which you are alone, is
  absent. But waiting for, or catching up with the other guy is a bit
  tricky. I wonder how it would be with a bigger group.

+ I tried to keep going at about 60% effort and I still had quite a
  bit of juice left in me, at the end of the ride.

+ My cycle is definitely good! I really only understood this after
  exchanging my cycle.

+ Exchanging cycles felt nice. A slightly different set of muscles
  were in action. The newness kinda helped.

+ I should probably get myself a bigger round frame spectacles. Or I'm
  craning my neck a bit too much, to keep looking ahead, while
  pedaling. How about contacts?

+ The problem with riding on the left of Highways is that you
  "compete" with heavy vehicles. It sometimes gets a bit scary.

+ I should get a helmet soon.

+ I should get in touch with local cycling groups and tag along with
  them on a couple of rides. I'll get to learn a lot of things.

+ Ritesh took a few pics with his phone. +Photos in some later post or
  with an update+.

+ Where to next? A ride inside the National park, probably or the
  wonderful roads of Navi Mumbai.

Kudos Ritesh!

*UPDATE:* A few pictures, that Ritesh clicked on his phone. All the
photos were on the Godbander Road.

After a short break, I'm back to blogging!
A few things have changed meanwhile. A lot haven't.

+ Noetic Nought shall now be called Rustic Reverie.

+ The Blogs I read page is now manually populated. More pages might be
  coming soon.

+ My web presence has almost been reduced to just this blog. I hope to
  be blogging more often this time around. I guess I'll have shorter
  and more frequent posts. "Release early, Release often."

+ I've been inspired by Sacha Chua and her wonderful blog. She puts up
  anything that -
  - she may look up in future.
  - could be remotely useful to anybody on this planet.

  I like her idea of "thinking of writing as sketching". "Keep
  repeating yourself, until the core message floats to the top". It
  feels similar to the idea - "Release early, Release often."

+ Also, Thanks to Madhu and Vattam who set an impossibly high standard
  by having their resumes and letters of recommendations and other
  "personal" stuff on version control on public repositories.

+ All my posts will be made from org2blog - a little org-mode based
  client that I hacked up. Emacs and Org-mode all the way! This is the
  first post by me (and probably anybody) from org2blog!

I want to be a part of the "reader-space" of blogs or web-sites
rather than a part of the Google-reader ecosystem.

As most of my readers know, I'm big on Google Reader (and I have a
reputation for that!). I'm a part of a wonderful ecosystem and get
to look-at or read a lot of interesting stuff. I get a lot of
variety, stuff that I wouldn't normally have come across. It keeps
me from staying in a tiny well, reading the same kind of stuff,
over and over again. I also like the fact that it acts as an
archival system for me. I can go back and read posts, which don't
exist on the web, anymore.

But, I have a problem with this ecosystem. It's killing the the
communities around the blogs or sites, themselves. The reader
count may have gone up, but the discussion and activity of the
community on the blogs is going down; at least on the blogs I look
at. Blogs are rather dead, these days. But, when one's following
over 200 blogs, you can't expect much better. It is difficult to
keep up with all of them; even the ones that one kept up well
with, before. People stop going back to the comments; stop
participating in the discussion.

Do you agree? Do you think it'll help it feed readers keep track
of the comments and updates? Or is the only way to cut down on
feed-reading and getting back to the old exciting way of checking
out blogs? I recall an old quote I read - If it's not worth
remembering, it's not worth reading.

*UPDATE:* I wasn't talking of my blog or comments here, in
 particular (if that's not already clear). I was talking of blogs,
 that I read regularly, blogs of people I know well (including
 mine). But then, there are blogs, that have over 1000 comments on
 a single post, too. Should the above quote could be changed to
 read - "If it's not worth reading, it's not worth remembering." ?

A Rocking.. err.. Pebbling.. err.. Pedaling Trip. IIT Bombay,
Powai to the Gateway of India. I simply loved it!

The original plan was to land somewhere near Chowpatty beach, but
I had some useless landmarks and I got lost. I was not too
particular about going to a particular place, so didn't try too
hard to stay on track and was happy to end up at the
Gateway. Thanks to the Mumbai local, I don't know the road
routes. But, again thanks to the Mumbai local, I have a general
idea of the direction.

I woke up a bit later than scheduled, but almost made up for the
delay until I reach my cycle to find the rear tyre fully flat. I
quickly diagnosed the problem to be with the valve. But, I had no
spare valve, unless, I "borrow" it from a cycle near-by. I
replaced my valve with Vattam's cycle's and was good to go!

I didn't have a big enough water bottle, and carried along only
half a litre after drinking one half litre. The first half hour
was a breeze; possibly the best part of the whole ride. High on
energy and enthu. Then, my groin/ass started to hurt a bit. I
pulled out my music player to drown the pain in music. This kinda
worked and I pulled on pretty well until King's circle. That's
when I emptied all the water I had. I hoped to find water along
the way, if I badly needed it.

Sometime later, I had to take a right turn, but I never knew
where. I didn't bother to ask anyone, nor did I look at the
landmarks I had scribbled down. I was happy to go straight
ahead. :)

And by the time I reached CST/Fort, I did need water; badly
enough. I stopped at the next open shop (that was not a
pan-ki-dukaan) and got myself some Nimbu paani and a litre of
water (for future).

The Gateway of India was just 10 minutes away from here.  Loitered
around there, for about 40 minutes. There were a lot of Policemen
all over the place. After about 5 minutes of me reaching there,
they cleared the whole area right next to the Gateway of India. I
don't know why. (Also, all along the way, there were a lot of men
in Khaaki. I guess there's some rally or some such thing
scheduled)

On the return, I lost my way almost immediately after
starting. There was a one way road that I avoided and took the
adjacent road but ended up going off-track. I had some doubts
about this but they weren't confirmed until I reached Mahalaxmi
station! But there, a Taxi driver gave me rough guidelines to get
back on my track. I turned back and soon was "back-on-track".

I'd planned to have breakfast at Idli house, as soon as I saw it
during my onward journey. So, I went directly to Idli house, and
treated myself to a Rava idli and some wonderful Kaapi. The waiter
got tipped well, too. ;)

From Matunga, back to IIT was straight forward; except for the
growing traffic and the PITA (literally). The traffic signals were
a bit annoying, too.

On the whole was an awesome trip! I loved it. Hope to go on more
such rides. But, I guess I'll head north-ward, the next time.

By the way, it was approx. 60kms on the whole and took me 5 hours
(including the time I spent at the Gateway of India) with about 3
hours 40 mins of pedaling.. err.. rocking. :D

Come spring -
a fresh lease of green
drapes the bare branches.

The leaves, dancing and whistling
to the tunes of the wind
playing, screaming, and singing,
in each other's company, enjoying.

Singing to one another
promises of sticking together,
come what may, through it all.

The song goes on,
but the count goes down,
not noticed or just unacknowledged,
first by one and then by many more.

the song, still, goes on.
And the promises too, of course.
The song goes on and on and on.

Until silence falls upon, when all

watches on - it won't be long before

My first Cricket match in a stadium. I regret that it was a
T-20. I'm happy, though, to have got the darshan of bhaiyya a.k.a
Sachin. Also, I did enjoy the energy of being in a stadium.

I was actually intent on watching MI vs. RR, but, junta voted in
favor of the Opening Ceremony. It was a grandiloquent let-down,
but for the fireworks. There was nothing really spectacular about
the ceremony. A mediocre performance... With the kind of money
they have at hand, and have spent, I really would've liked
something better.

The match. DC vs. KKR. DC lost a game that it could've comfortably
won. It would've been a decent match to watch, if not for the
stupid DJ-ing. The game looked so different from what I'm used to
seeing on the TV. [The only thing that was exactly as I saw in TV
was, the crowd drooling at the cheer girls.]

I was shocked by the amount of disturbance a player has to
overcome, while playing. Has the "gentle-man's" game turned into a
"super-man's" game? Between each and every ball, the DJ is either
shouting some incomprehensible inanities or playing some crazy
"number" at the highest volume. The batsmen almost had to wait for
him to shut up, before each ball. Can someone tell me if these are
perks that the third version brings with it, or if I was happily
ignorant, thanks to the TV watching? The heart-beat sound in the
final overs was ridiculously annoying. I was looking forward to
one of the batsmen throwing his bat at the DJ.

Also, it's a big joke to call this ground a "home" for DC. It was
nothing close to a home ground, in terms of the crowd. I don't see
Cuttack being any more homely, especially with the Kalinga Sena
already passing crazy orders to the cricketers. DC will have to
play exceedingly well to end-up anywhere near the top.  But,
amidst all this, I'm happy for the people of AP. With a huge
electric-power crisis looming ahead, they have already saved (or
produced) power worth 7 IPL matches!

Also, this is the end of IPL v3 for me. I'm done with cricket for
this season.

This post is my attempt to start a travelogue. I hope to capture
the "All India Tour" phase of my life (as people have started to
call it).  I'll try to keep these posts from becoming travel
guides. There are loads of them and I surely don't need to
increment count.

This post is after a trip to Kanpur, Agra and Sikri.

- Trains are never on Time. The delay increases exponentially with
  your distance from the sourthern most tip of the country. Also,
  the confidence of the aam admi in this delay is proportional to
  the distance. Any delay less than an hour wasn't considered to
  be a delay. Thanks to the fog, low visibility.
- If you want to travel around India, all you need is an
  SLR. Additionally, if you are not of Indian origin, you'll need
  the "India" guide. I got bored of seeing people poring over the
  pages of that "blue" India book or madly clicking away on their
  SLRs.
- Whether or not you get food or water on a train, you are assured
  of enough "chilled" air from the slit under your window. Come
  what may, you shall not be deprived of this service.
- The trust of a person in you is inversely proportional to the
  difference between your ages. It is inversely proportional to
  the 2.718th power of the difference if you are aged between 20
  and 25. I only vaguely remember what the TTE told me in my
  sleep, while paying the fine for not carrying a print out of our
  e-ticket; but, it really was something sick and senseless.
- The chill at a place, on the day you reach, is inversely
  proportional to how much people have scared/warned you. On the
  rest of the days, it is proportional to the square of the warm
  clothing you have on you. I thoroughly enjoyed the chill of
  Kanpur. Wonderful! The infrastructure, too good! Never expected
  a 50 year old campus to be so Awesome. [They have an air-strip
  too!]
- The thrill of having an ice-cream is proportional to the square
  of difference between the ambient temperature and the standard
  room temperature.
- Don't ever think of celebrating your escape, without the Aalu
  encounter. Welcome to the land of Alu addicted men. You shall,
  surely, have your share. If not anything else, you shall be
  serverd a Capsicum or Brinjal stuffed with Aalu. Also, the
  quality and availability of leather seems to be proportional to
  the addiction to Aalu.
- "hawker time" - the time you spend being followed by hawkers
  trying to convince you to buy whatever they
  have. "firang-ness" - difficult to predict; a parameter that
  depends on the amount of branded stuff on you, stylishness of
  your winter wear and other unknown variableness. Your hawker
  time is proportional to (firang-ness) \* abs(time of day in 24
  hr clock - 1400) [when, 900 < time < 1800] I understand, that,
  they need to make ends meet; each day of their lives. I got
  followed a lot. I can't help observing. Sometimes, enjoyed being
  followed too.

The Taj. Simply Awe-Inspiring. As Madhu put it, "the longer you
keep watching it, the more it's beauty overwhelms you". But, I
still think, the first time is the best time to see it. It's
simply mind blowing when you get the first glimpse, after entering
from the West gate.

It's time to stop writing when all you can see is proportionality
between totally unrelated things.  Here are a few pics

Shantanu and I conducted a workshop on Scipy at GNUnify '10. It
was intended to be an introduction to Scipy and Numpy through
Image processing. We expected an audience which was python
literate. But GNUnify's schedule wasn't too favorable for us. Ours
was the first talk scheduled and we ended up getting people who
only "heard" of Python, the language.

We had planned quite a bit of stuff expecting a python literate
audience. But unfortunately, we had to start almost from scratch
and couldn't do all of what we planned. Still, the workshop wasn't
too bad. Nobody left mid-way during the 2 hour workshop; nobody
was dozing either.  I would have liked my first talk at a FOSS

Like most bloggers, I keep looking at my blogs hits once in a
while. (Sometimes inspires to write better; and more often.) The
post that gets most hits these days is my post on mailman,
postfix, et al. But the search term that's increasingly bringing
people to my blog is "punchagan".

This scares me. What makes people search for me? What makes people
search more often these days? Why am I scared?

Why do people use monikers or online identities? I started off
with the idea of anonymity and privacy; keeping my online identify
separate from my real one. But it, obviously, is a folly to have
you email id with the same handle. Now, almost anybody who knows
me, also knows my online handle. They can find me anywhere and
everywhere with just a few keystrokes (and Google). Also, the
uniqueness of my handle doesn't help one bit. Any search returns
over 90% relevant results.

Is it time to get lost in the crowd with a new handle? ;) Probably
not. I don't have much to hide under the covers. Let the world see
-- who I am, who I have been; where I am, where I have been.

Peace.

I'm now officially a part of the Arch Linux community! Arch Linux
is a lightweight and flexible Linux® distribution that tries to
Keep It Simple.

I have started using arch from less than a week or so. It took me
a while, not too long, to realize the beauty of this distro. I was
trying to tweak the settings of my org-mode's remember (on
Karmic), trying to make it work the way I liked it. After breaking
my head with .emacs and lisp for a while, I realized the version
of my org-mode was way different from the version of the docs, I
was reading. It didn't take long to figure out, which version of
org-mode to get. As a matter of curiosity, I checked AUR for the
version, and true to Arch's reputation it was bleeding edge! I was
still using Karmic, since I hadn't got my Arch installation
working the way I like it, yet. Out of laziness. sudo reboot; to
hell with laziness!

I was setting up things I regularly use, tweaking my way
around. After a day or so, I find python-numpy is out of date. And
to top it, an orphaned package! I didn't feel one bit good about
this. After some futile attempts to suppress my discomfort, I sat
down to work.

After an afternoon of effort, I created my first PKGBUILD. :) I
now have python-numpy installed using pacman! Pleasure to join the
Arch User Community! Also, thanks to lifeeth and Lynus Vaz, for
the sparks.

PS: I'm using Arch with Openbox. It's neat! PPS: org-mode is
really awesome! It's a world in itself. life in plain text,

I've been caught "shooting" with a camera and looked upon as
'terrorist' material. Not once or twice, but 4 times, at 3
different places, by different people. Friends with "pro" cameras
(or pro-looking ones) have been stopped on quite a few occasions
being mistaken for reporters. I'm not talking of those
instances. I am counting the times when I've been in "real"
trouble and was treated as a potential terrorist. Four Times.

The last time was special, since I was robbed of cash by a Public
servant in the 'Khakhi', who was apparently doing his duties! I
leave the cribbing about corrupt men and lost cash for later. It
obviously didn't feel nice, being treated in that fashion.

And that, just for having a camera and trying to learn the art of
"shooting" pictures. Thankfully, it was something that I could,
shut off (along with my mouth) and throw into my backpack.

What of people born to parents who believe in a particular

Don't tell me I didn't warn you, if you walk into our lab sometime
and mistake it for a game zone in your neighbourhood. You are
indeed in "the" lab. If you came looking for Prof. Prabhu you'll
have to return. You'll only find PR vowing to see the end of
baali, for having a nice time pawning him. You won't find me
around - I'm cloaked and busy creating havoc. Unless, of course,
you are the seer KD. Watch your step extremely carefully or you
won't know when and how fuchmed's GM hit you. And don't dare
venture anywhere near madrazr, jumping all around with a
shockwave, unless you are capable enjoying some real nasty
shocks. Well, the team is busy in one of it's two SB sessions per
day. SB (short for Stress Buster) sessions are intense 15 minute
rounds of bzflag - 3D first person tank battle game.

Hope you didn't start thinking, I'm just goofing off here, doing
nothing at all. If it's not already clear, SB sessions are exactly
what they are called - Stress Busters. Just to refresh ourselves
and get back to work, with greater force. What then, am I doing
for the rest of my time?

Mainly I've been developing course content that we have been
working on, called Software Tools, Techniques and Practices. I
have been working on a session for elementary LaTeX and basic
Linux tools. I've also been attending classes of Digital Control
and trying to Python-ize the Matlab/Scilab code that the course
uses.

But, that's not all. I've helped a guy restore a Joomla site on
Day-1. I screwed up a brand new installation of a server with some
real skill; then expect to be screwed but get some encouragement
with the words, "It was a good learning experience for us." Seen a
Debian server upgrade from Etch to Lenny in under 10
minutes. Installed an instance of twiki and struggled to configure
it. Helped a Humanities Scholar with LaTeX. Attended a workshop on
Instruction Design. Restored Qmail on an old Fedora 3
server. Goofed around in gimp, for a CD cover and a T-shirt
design. Chipped in with bits, for mutating Ubuntu into
"LivePython". Did a bit of css and javascript tweaking... The list
goes on!

Now, don't you think we deserve the SB's? ;)

Lost in thought, in the maddening crowd waiting for the next train
on a Sunday evening, I was staring blankly, looking at nothing in
particular. I had come to see-off UC, Sunil and 9.

A man carrying a stretcher on his head, suddenly comes into my
focus and I have an impulse to look down. But, I manage to look at
people who are closer to the guy, and see looks of pity, shock and
disgust. Most of them looked down, sooner than later. It was not
long before the man, was right next to me and I could see an
injured man lying on the stretcher with a stream of blood oozing
out of his head. All I could manage was another expression of
pity, shock and disgust. I didn't want to act as if I had seen
nothing. I didn't want to stay as if I could do nothing about
it. I didn't want to look down. But, that's all I ended up
doing. The man carrying the stretcher was not exactly struggling,
but I'm sure he would've more than liked some help. Not one
amongst us moved.

Around half a minute later, I see a constable walking calmly
(maybe with a shade of concern in his stride) in that
direction. The next train was there in less than a minute and 9
got into it. I was feeling absolute disgust at my reaction. In the
hope of making some amends, I walked in the direction that the
stretcher guy took. Soon I found them. I didn't have to
search. There was an audience of onlookers, watching the stretcher
carrying guy inspect the other guy. He was waiting near the
entrance of the station and I'm guessing he had called for some
medical help and was waiting for it to arrive. The policeman and a
couple of others were standing next to him, while he was
inspecting the injuries. Everybody else was watching --- from the
stairs, from the over bridge, the platform, the
tracks. Everywhere. Being a part of that crowd was the last thing
I wanted to do. I walked away.

PS: I (infact, we - uc, sunil, 9 and me) have had my own tryst
with the Mumbai local. Keep your head on your shoulders, while you
are anywhere near them. They are not the trains in your local

Well, this could be called a post after ages, considering that
most of previous posts have just been 'news reports'. I have been
wanting to make a post since long, but I probably lost it. I
really am unable to write anything that I find worth posting [It
does raise questions about the existence of this blog. I'm writing
this, to answer that question to myself.]

This post is provoked by an act of sharing, an act of kindness, an
act of goodness, that surprised me. This post isn't about the act
itself, but it's about me being surprised. Why on earth should I
(or anybody) be surprised, when someone is just being human?
Aren't human beings meant to be and feel human?

I wonder why people say, "this is a bad, bad world." I find a lot
of goodness and humanness around me. Unless I strain my memory
really hard, I can only recall people who try to be as good and
nice as they can be; People trying to be as human as
possible. Either there's something utterly wrong with my judgment
of people or there's something wrong with the general feeling that
the world is a bad, bad place.

There's one other possibility that just strikes me - I am so nice
to people that, everyone else tries to be nice with me. I don't
think I am such a big deviation from the average. I'm just another
goat, in the great herd.

And another one, I'm in a really special place, presently. I have
been only to the special places. I have visited only the places
that are at an extreme, far away from the 'average' place in the
world. But, given I'm just another goat in the great herd, this is
very unlikely. I am probably grazing at a random spot on the great
grasslands.

Since these are ruled out, it boils down to either a wrong
judgment or a wrong general feeling.

Coming to my judgment, I wouldn't call myself an Oracle or the
wise one, but I'm no dumb ass either. Well, taking the statistical
route, the number of times I've had any real "nasty" surprises in
dealing with people has been much lesser than the number of times
things turned out nearly as expected. My judgment could,
therefore, possibly given some credibility.

So, that leaves me with just one possibility. The idea that the
world is a bad, bad place is not entirely true, if not completely
absurd and outright wrong. The world is really a nice place, with
"human" beings inhabiting it. The nasty surprises that you get,
really are the surprises and not the general rule.

* DONE Postfix + Mailman for Multiple Domains. :ology:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: postfix-mailman-for-multiple-domains
:EXPORT_DATE: 2009-08-05T01:23:00+05:30
:END:




Well, there are a hazaar tutorials on setting up Postfix and
Mailman for Debian for a single domain. There were a few for doing
that for multiple domains also, but nothing comprehensive, if I
could say so. This link is pretty comprehensive and details all
the steps for setting up Postfix for a single domain.  Here is all
you'll want to know about setting up Virtual domains in Postfix.

You only need to make a few changes for adding a second (or more)
domain. You just need to add the =virtual_alias_domains= and add
=virtual_alias_maps=. Here is a glimpse of how my =main.cf= looks:

#+begin_example
myhostname = mail.abc.in
mydomain = abc.in
mydestination = $myhostname, $mydomain, localhost.$mydomain
myorigin = /etc/mailname
virtual_alias_maps =
                hash:/etc/postfix/virtual-xyz,
                hash:/etc/postfix/virtual-abc,
                hash:/var/lib/mailman/data/virtual-mailman
virtual_alias_domains = xyz.in, mail.xyz.in
#+end_example

=virtual-xyz= and =virtual-abc= contain the virtual aliases for
each domain. Note that Postfix expects hash files and hence you
need to run =postmap /etc/postfix/virtual-abc= each
time the file is changed, to keep the hash file in sync with the
text file that you edit. Also, you need to run =postfix reload=,
each time you make changes to =main.cf= or =master.cf=

Fairly straight forward, right? But it took me quite sometime to
get it all right, since this was the first time I was doing
anything with Mail Transfer Agents or the like.

Now, onto Mailman. Well the Installation Manual of Mailman,
literally has it all. Here is a look at how my
=mm_cfg.py= looks:

#+begin_example
DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST = 'abc.in'
DEFAULT_URL_HOST   = 'mail.abc.in'
add_virtualhost(DEFAULT_URL_HOST, DEFAULT_EMAIL_HOST)
POSTFIX_STYLE_VIRTUAL_DOMAINS=['xyz.in']
add_virtualhost('mail.xyz.in', 'xyz.in')
MTA='Postfix'
#+end_example

The only trouble was to get mailing lists with same names on both
the domains (which I couldn't get working). I experimented with
multiple mailman instances but that won't work because the MTA
can't differentiate between the two instances of mailman. The
alternative is probably to have two instances of postfix running
too. But that I felt was like going too far, and gave up. [What if
we wanted to add another domain to the list?!]

Also, I had to make a few alterations to the Apache file to allow
access to the mailman pages without breaking the Zope redirection
that was already set-up.

[Thanks to Shantanu and Vattam (and all the hazaar people using
Postfix and Mailman and cared to document things for the sake of
others, and of course Google)]

I had the opportunity to attend a FOSS talk session organized by
Center for Distance Education Engineering Programme (CDEEP) as a
part of the National Mission on Education through ICT. The
National Mission on Education through ICT has some lofty goals,
which when reached will take the country ahead by leaps and
bounds.

The Mission has a budget of $1billion in the 11th Five year plan,
40% of which will be spent on content generation (all of which
will be free/open source) and the rest will be spent on making
available a minimum bandwidth of 1Gbps to the 30,000 odd colleges
spread over India (out of which around 3000 are Engineering
colleges). The mission has various projects planned and they are
picking up steam rapidly. The project I will be working on, for
the Adoption of Open Source in Engineering and Science Education
in India, is also a part of this Mission. Prof. Kannan had kick
started the session with an introduction to the National Mission
on Education through ICT. The talks were all being webcast to
various EduSAT centers and on the web.

Then, Prof. Pathak talked on, why open source is important. He
said, (not exactly quoting him) " It is theoritically possible for
any person to learn and discover things from scratch, but there's
been only one Ekalavya in the entire history of India." Education
is a social activity and hence open access to content is
absolutely vital. He mentioned various things like how IIT-B has
been working on Creative Commons licensing and other things going
on here. He ended the talk with a hope that soon India will move
from being a net taker of Open source to a net giver to open
source.

This was followed by three talks, delivered by developers from
RedHat meant for programmers who wish to contribute to FLOSS.

The first talk was by Ramakrishna Reddy, titled 10 things a FLOSS
developer should know. It was a pretty nice and balanced talk,
covering a wide range of things. I would like to point out a few
things, that I liked the most.

- He clarified the term hacker as soon as he used it.
- He emphasized a lot on groking code; reading code for fun,
  looking at the code of others, reading as much code as
  possible...
- He talked of muscle memory of emacsen. I liked the way he talked
  of people being so quick with their editors and how learning to
  use your tools effectively is a big plus
- Release often, Release early. Everybody talks of it, but he said
  a few words, which I liked. Some developers don't usually
  release their code as early for the fear of being ridiculed. But
  don't bother, "we are just small people, in the whole galaxy."

The next talk was by Prasad Pandit on How to use Infrastructure
for FOSS projects. Prasad talked of Website, Version Control,
Mailing list, IRC, Bugzilla, Wiki and RSS feeds. He gave quite a
few examples on how each thing is important, most of the examples
being his personal experiences.

The last talk was by Rahul Sundaram and was on Communication in a
FOSS project. For a change he didn't have slides and the reason
for that, he said, is that communication in a FOSS project is
casual and not having slides and walking in with a t-shirt and
jeans represents that casualness which is a culture of FOSS
projects' communication.

- Be polite, but don't be Formal.
- Be precise, but do provide a context to what you are saying.
- Don't fear that you'll say something foolish, which, will be
  archived for eternity. Mistakes are there to learn from. Not
  just you, but others too.

He talked of quite a lot of things, but these were the things
which struck me as particularly interesting/important.

At the end, all the participants walked out with Fedora 11 DVDs
from the RedHat/Fedora guys. :D

    Our design of this introductory computer-science subject
    reflects two major concerns. First, we want to establish the
    idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a
    computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel
    formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus,
    programs must be written for people to read, and only
    incidentally for machines to execute. Second, we believe that
    the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this
    level is not the syntax of particular programming-language
    constructs, nor clever algorithms for computing particular
    functions efficiently, nor even the mathematical analysis of
    algorithms and the foundations of computing, but rather the
    techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of
    large software systems.

    I would like to see a few courses developed on similar lines here.
- Gmail themes are good. I only tried the "Terminal" theme,
  though. I loved it!
- For the very first time, I upgraded a distro. I successfully
  moved to Intrepid from Hardy. (and that too with the campus

  should be a much simpler job to achieve the same

*The Happy Birthday Song*

Once a year we celebrate
With stupid hats and plastic plates
The fact that you were able to make
Another trip around the sun

And the whole clan gathers round
And gifts and laughter do abound
And we let out a joyful sound
And sing that stupid song

Happy birthday!
Now you're one year older!
Happy birthday!
Your life still isn't over!
Happy birthday!
You did not accomplish much
But you didn't die this year
I guess that's good enough

So let's drink to your fading health
And hope you don't remind yourself
The chance of finding fame and wealth
Decrease with every year

Does it feel like you're doing laps
And eating food and taking naps
And hoping that someday perhaps
Your life will hold some cheer

Happy birthday!
What have you done that matters?
Happy birthday!
You're starting to get fatter
Happy birthday!
It's downhill from now on
Try not to remind yourself
Your best years are all gone

If cryogenics were all free
Then you could live like Walt Disney
And live for all eternity
Inside a block of ice

But instead your time is set
This is the only life you get
And though it hasn't ended yet
Sometimes you wish it might

Happy birthday!
You wish you had more money
Happy birthday!
Your life's so sad it's funny
Happy birthday!
How much more can you take?
But your friends are hungry
So just cut the stupid cake

Happy birthday!

This Notice from the Computer Center is creating waves all

Academic activities; wonder what it's definition is, in their
dictionaries. It surely includes the following.

- Using Internet for 'academic activities' or emails, during
  class-room hours makes no sense.
- Anything 'academic' cannot have a size greater than 5 MB.
- Accessing version control systems ( svn, cvs et al ) cannot be
  classified 'academic'
- IRC cannot teach you anything. Don't ever dream of thinking it
  as 'academic' to hang out on \#python or \#emacs
- All 'academic' stuff is limited to the http(s) ports. You
  wouldn't need to use any other ports, ever.
- Any 'academic' activity fits within a span of 2 hours or can be
  done in blocks of 2 hours each, with gaps of 2 hours in between.
- 'Academic' stuff doesn't definitely contain key-words chosen by
  the "all-knowing" admins.

Moreover, the people in-charge who refused to allow the use of a
computer in the CC as a server for on-campus repositories of
GNU/Linux packages, now wish to host a 'hub' for sharing
open-source softwares! There's already an official ftp server
which hosts the academic info and a few useful softwares. I don't
see how a hub would be different.

We don't have any disciplinary committees for people smoking in
hostel rooms, causing a lot of trouble for others around them, but
we are going to have them for hosting hubs. ( Well, a new law
banning smoking in public places in India has been passed just a
few days ago. Hopefully it'll work better than the older one,
since now there's some pressure on the people in-charge of the
public place. )

Also, it could be argued that college isn't meant only for
'academic' learning and a lots of other learning takes place here
(and the hubs were definitely helping quite a bit) but I'll leave
that for another day, probably. Also, I don't think 18+ year olds,
people who are about to step into various big roles, leading the
country need to be told how to make use of the
facilities/resources available to them; A degree of freedom is
indispensable, I believe.

I appreciate the efforts being made to improve the network
situation here and also help the students get the most (
'academically' ) out of their college experience, but I feel the
situation deserves more careful handling.

Three Cheers to 'Free Software'!

A toast for GNU on its 25th Birthday![fn:gnu-bday]

If you intend to ask, what I did on this day, I have nothing to show. I haven't done anything that's tangible but yes, I have re-dedicated myself to the idea of Free Software.
This post intends to shed some light on a few things (if not for the benefit of others, just as a reminder for myself)

- Free Software is a matter of liberty, not price. I've often been
  in a position that required me to correct people. 'Free
  Software' is software that's free as in free speech and not free
  beer. For the lack of a better word in english, the word 'free'
  which also means gratis has been used. Using the term 'Libre'
  sometimes helps and if you are in this part of the world, "mukt"
  is the best word to use.
- Free Software[fn:fs] comes along with four fundamental freedoms. To put
  it simply, the freedom to use, study, share and modify any
  software.
- Free Software may have the advantage of being 'technically
  sounder', but the philosophy is what matters the most to me.
- I will do whatever is possible within my capacity to spread the
  philosophy and the associated freedom

Be Free, My Friend!

Here is an extract from one of Stallman's [fn:rms] essays:

#+begin_quote
   We must talk about Freedom

   Estimates today are that there are ten million users of
   GNU/Linux systems such as Debian GNU/Linux and Red Hat
   Linux. Free software has developed such practical advantages
   that users are flocking to it for purely practical reasons.

   The good consequences of this are evident: more interest in
   developing free software, more customers for free software
   businesses, and more ability to encourage companies to develop
   commercial free software instead of proprietary software
   products.

   But interest in the software is growing faster than awareness
   of the philosophy it is based on, and this leads to
   trouble. Our ability to meet the challenges and threats
   described above depends on the will to stand firm for
   freedom. To make sure our community has this will, we need to
   spread the idea to the new users as they come into the
   community.

   But we are failing to do so: the efforts to attract new users
   into our community are far outstripping the efforts to teach
   them the civics of our community. We need to do both, and we
   need to keep the two efforts in balance.

This post is just to keep up a promise that I made to a friend of mine (well,
actually myself).  Presently, its the placement heat in our campus and people
are busy writing tests, waiting, giving interviews and partying. This post
doesn't have much to with all that though.  In one of the interviews, I was
called back and asked about my Cleft Lip and Palate[fn:clp]. The interview
panel had concerns if I faced any serious medical problems due to this. I
explained to them everything that I knew about it and they were convinced.

Later, I realized, I never explicitly did any reading on this issue or asked my
parents/others about this. I somehow knew about it always. I probably learnt at
all those visits to the dentist or may be sub-consciously, when I was a
baby. It isn't, though, surprising to me that those guys had some reservations
about it. It's not everyday that you see a guy with a Cleft, though statistics
say there's prevalence of 1 in 500 births world-wide. As a matter of fact, I
myself haven't seen another guy all my life (except for the pictures at my
dentists') (also, they weren't too wrong in suspecting other problems, though
they had absolutely no clue about this medical condition)

If you are wondering what the point of this post is, it's nothing. It's just a
pointer to those interested in reading further on Cleft Lip and Palate.

This post's been inspired by a wonderful book, "A Byte of
Python"[fn:BoP1] by Swaroop C H. The book has been revised after a
gap of nearly 4 years and the wait is worth it! I thoroughly loved
the book, and I'm happy to be accompanied by so many[fn:BoP2]
others[fn:BoP3]. This book has filled me with a sense of joy and
pride. The pride, of being part of such a wonderful community, a
beautiful crowd. Further, it is a matter of pride, the book's been
authored by an Indian - its quite rare to find such books written
by people in this part of the world.

I have loved python, the moment I started using it. There are
quite a few occasions, where I did something, just because I had
the power of Python with me. Python is undoubtedly amongst the
best, not just as a first programming language, but to give the
user a sense of "do-able-ity" and I am thoroughly enjoying it.

Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Its been 10 days on my sabbatical. I have done reasonably well
during the first week, but now its getting on my nerves. I have
realized how addicted I am to chat, IRC and the Internet. I have
to soon find some remedies for this.

Well, here is the first step. I approached ELIZA (or Doctor Fill,
that's actually the emacs mode) , the Emacs Psychotherapist to
help me. An enjoyable chat this one! ;)

ELIZA (Doctor Fill) abbreviated as DF (pun intended, for those who
get it)

#+begin_example
DF: I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
you are finished talking, type RET twice.

Hi. Nice meeting you.

DF: How do you do?  What brings you to see me?

<!--more-->I am obviously not fine, otherwise I would not have been here.
I have realized I am addicted to the internet and want you to help
me.

DF: Why do you say that?

I say that because you are a doctor.

DF: Is it because because I am a doctor that you came to me?

Isn't that pretty obvious?

DF: Can you elaborate on that?

Yes, I did come to see you because you are a doctor. Now, I regret it.

DF: Does it bother you that I am a doctor now you regret it?

I don't understand your question.

DF: Earlier you said because I am a doctor?

Yes, because you are a doctor I came to you.

DF: When did you first know that I am a doctor you came to me?

I knew about you, when I first fiddled around with Emacs around an
year ago.

DF: What happened when you first fiddled around with emacs around a year
ago?

I loved it, thoroughly! But for a beginner like me it was difficult to
get along. I stopped using it.

DF: Is the fact that for a beginner like you it was difficult to get along
you stopped using it the real reason?

I think that along with my laziness to stick with the learning was the
real reason

DF: Does the fact that along with your laziness to stick with the learning
was the real reason explain anything else?

It does not explain anything else to me.

DF: Maybe your plans have something to do with this.

What plans? I donot have any plans.

DF: What makes you believe what plans you donot have any plans?

If I had plans, I would have been executing them.

DF: You mentioned that I am a doctor now you regret it?

Yes, because you seemed stupid initially. Now you seem to be making
some sense.

DF: Are you sure I seemed stupid initially now I seem to be making some
sense?

Yes I am pretty sure.

DF: Is it because of your life that you are going through all this?

Obviously. Because I am alive I am going through all this.

DF: Is it because you are alive you are going through all this that you
came to me?

Yes.

DF: I see...  Well, are you sure that this is so?

Yes. I don't think there is emacs in the hell.

DF: I would appreciate it if you would watch your tongue!

Oh! so emacs is in the hell too! is it in the heavan too?

DF: Emacs?  Hah!  Perhaps you could continue.

I thought only mortals used Emacs. Do others use it too?

DF: Have you been positive?

Yes. I always thought Emacs is only for the homo sapiens.

DF: I believe you have inhibitions with emacs.

No. I love emacs.
But it isn't suitable for Gods and Demons

DF: Are you annoyed that it is not suitable for gods and demons?

No

DF: Why not?

I am neither of them. That's why

DF: Please, continue.

I am a human and I can use emacs. Others donot need it. I am not annoyed

DF: Have you been annoyed often?

Ocassionally

DF: Go on, don't be afraid.

I am not. I have been ocassionally annoyed, more often with myself
than others.

DF: What causes you to be annoyed?

Presently, I am annoyed with myself for being addicted to the Internet
and may be for chatting with you too.

DF: Do you really think you are annoyed?

Affirmative

DF: I need a little more detail please.

Yes. I am a little annoyed with myself.

DF: Are you annoyed often?

Ocassionally. Why do you repeat questions?

DF: When did you first know that do me repeat questions?

Long Long ago, when I first used Emacs.

DF: What makes you think long long ago when you first used emacs?

I saw you repeat questions.

DF: Is it because of the people you hang around with that you say you saw
me repeat questions?

Yes.

DF: Yes, hmmm... so, why do you say this is so?

I am leaving. You are being too repititive. Goodbye!

DF: What makes you believe because I am a doctor?

Goodbye!

DF: My secretary will send you a bill.

Bill? You did not help me much.

DF: How do you reconcile problems at school?

Goodbye!

DF: Bye bye.

Bye

DF: See ya.

See ya.

DF: Are you sure that see me?

Yes, when in trouble

DF: What would happen if in trouble?

I will see ya

DF: Earlier you said I am a doctor you came to me?

Yes, now also I say that.

DF: You're being a bit brief, would you please go into detail.

Goodbye!

DF: Ok, talk to you some other time.

bye!

DF: Talk to you later.

Well, this isn't an update of how I'm doing on my sabbatical. Its
just been 3 days and I'm doing pretty fine.  I just finished
writing a script to keep my blogs page in sync with my
google-reader (well not exactly). The script parses an xml export
of my google-reader-subscriptions and updates the edits the html
of my unnought-blogs page. period.

There are a couple of things I don't like about this script.

Firstly, I don't want to keep exporting my
google-reader-subscription each time I make changes. The script
should be able to directly sync with my google-reader without me
having to export the file.  [I have read about the atom
subscriptions feed of Google Reader, but haven't been able to get
it right.] Hopefully, I'll be able to do it in the near future.

Secondly, The blog author's name is non-existent. I can't do
anything about this though.

I hadn't been much in the City for the past three years. I've had
a little trouble recollecting the exact routes and corresponding
bus numbers. I Googled for it, with little hope, and the results
didn't surprise me. There wasn't much info in this regard. On the
occasion of World Environment, when the focus is on promoting the
use of Public Transport, this isn't a very encouraging sign.

I was wondering if the Bus route info can somehow be integrated
with Google maps or the like. This will be a good thing to do,
since people who have access to internet (the higher rungs of the
society) are the ones who are most aware of the threats to the
Environment and also the ones who least use public transport. This
could help them do some planning and encourage use of public
transport. Later on, may be the Buses could have some kind of a
GPS sytem that could be interlinked with the maps, giving people
great power! I'm not sure if this already exists elsewhere in the
world, but seemed an interesting thing to do.

On a different note, just wanted to share this different
perspective my mom was giving to my 7 year old neice. We were on a
bus and my niece wasn't very happy about the crowd and the Bus
journey. My mom, then said something, probably to amuse the kid
and distract her for a while. But its an interesting way of
looking at things.

#+begin_quote
You should be proud that you are aboard a bus that costs around 15
lacs, something we wouldn't normally be able to buy. And that too
for a small sum of Rs. 5. You are being driven around by a
chauffeur employed by the State Govt. and you needn't bother
yourself with the routes and other headaches of driving you'd have
if you used your personal car...
#+end_quote

The kid wasn't convinced or even amused by this, but I liked the
interesting observation. Some food for thought, My mom travels for
an hour and half by bus to reach her work and she's been doing so
since I was a kid of 5 or 6. Now I know why she's been able to do
it for so many years, everyday!

Internships, No Projects, No GRE plans (a little pushing for GRE
has just started from the junta around.)

Just to kill some time and to learn some Python, I have begun to
write an IRC chat bot &lt;lafoobot&gt; [Lafoot + Bot]. The present
haven of lafoobot is #fosskelog @ irc.freenode.net. Join in, if
you want to have a chat! ;) Lafoobot can presently do very few
things

- "Yoyo", a newly joined user
- "Hello"/ "Yoyo", a user or pass on a Hello/Yoyo from user to
  another.
- Gives Local time / GMT
- Gives a random word and its meaning [put in for the junta
  preparing for GRE ;)]
- Gives out an MOTD or a fortune when it first joins \#fosskelog
- Googles a search term and returns the top 5 results (This is my
  favourite feature and this is the reason partially for this
  post. "!google lafoobot" doesn't return anything. Hopefully not
  anymore.)

If you have ideas for any other features or if you want to have a
look at the source, comment here or join #fosskelog. lafoobot's
code is licensed under GPLv2!

the two FOSS events I attended. Yes, two events, Sat and Sun, both

why) Hoping to have some more action this summer!

that there aren't enough people who get them painted, pastes the

by, are having a good time watching that beautiful looking woman
there or fantasizing themselves in that wonderful car up

Back again with another khichdi of a post.

- Quark, Waves and Apogee. [For the uninitiated, Quark is our
  technical festival and Waves, our Cul-fest] I had been to
  BITS-Pilani, for attending their Tech-fest, Apogee.
    - One would expect Apogee to end up the best, but we were
      thoroughly disappointed. It came nowhere near the perfection
      of Quark and things seemed quite unprofessional. Hats-off to
      Chaitu n others in the Quark Org-Co. I'm already worried
      about missing Quark'09 [thanks to my PS]
    - The specials at all three events were unforgettable. Feeding
      the Fish, the Air Shows (Naval and Amateur planes), the
      Orchestral performance, Special Performance [Aasra], Sand
      art by Gagan and Mithali!
    - Had the opportunity, to meet/have a look at some of the guys
      studying at colleges in their home towns. For once, I felt
      being in a "reputed", national college does matter.
    - Felt good spending some time with good ol' friends at
      Pilani.
    - Always believed organizing events isn't my forte, but,
      helped organize a couple of events at Quark. Feels good.
    - Effective Communication is less about how well you choose
      your words but more about your quantum of concern for the
      other person and the matter at hand!

- Pilani Campus, Love at First sight. Never really felt like
  coming back.
    - The arts/non-technical clubs there are simply superb! We
      have a lot to learn
    - Cycling on campus. A dream come true!
    - All Night Canteen is a real hangout place!
    - Green, Greener, Greenest. Never really felt like we were in
      the deserts of Rajasthan.
    - .... the list can go on and on. I'll stop here.

- FOSS n me.
    - Attended my first FOSS event! The Install Fest @
      Quark. Wasn't as awe inspiring as I would've liked it to be,
      but still a memorable one. Simply for being my first
      install-fest and for the lessons we learnt.
    - FOSSKriti'08 is one event I'll regret missing. It was
      absolutely amazing. I'm just hoping, people here too get to
      that level soon enough.
    - Free Software and Freeware ain't the same stuff. It's
      extremely painful when people address FOSS stuff as
      freeware. Free Software is Software that's Free as in Free
      Speech n Freeware is software that if free as in free beer.
    - Eagerly awaiting mukt.in v2. Can't wait to get back home!
    - Enjoying my time on \#mukt.in and \#linux-india. The new DC
      hub (GNOME) for FOSS junta is cool too!
    - There's an urgent need to start contributing to FOSS. But
      how?

- Haven't yet found myself an intern/project for summer. Wonder
  what's in store, this summer.
- Most of the gang's On-Campus next sem. Will really miss Voodoo
  though. Hoping he has a rocking PS.
- Hoping we won't have to shift hostels next sem.
- Appreciation is a great motivator. Expressing it promptly is
  important. I'm bad at it. Should work on it.
- "The gang" is like a flock of birds in flight.
- This semester is coming to an end already, and I don't have
  anything I'd be proud of.
- Wonder why I have absolutely no feelings about the farewell we'd
  be having soon.
- Awaiting Ugadi Celebs. Seems like they are gonna rock more than
  ever.
- Gone are those days, when I used to post because something I had
  to write about, compelled me to do so. These days, the long
  inactivity on my blog is turning out to be the sole reason for
  my posts. [A few Rare Exceptions though, and this one isn't] I
  wonder if its because life's become uneventful or because I grew
  lazier or because of something else.
- I don't like posting accounts of events from the recent/distant
  past, but I'm doing it just to prevent my blog's death.

In memory of two gems, Koteshwar Rao Sir and Madhusudhan.

This, surely is a tremendous loss for the world, especially the
world of Math. I pray, from the bottom of my heart, May your Souls
rest in peace.

I got to know both of them at the same place, IIT Study Circle,
Hyderabad. Its not for long that I've been there and known them,
but both of them definitely have a special place in my heart.

Koti, as we lovingly called him, will always remain an inspiration
for me. ( and hundreds of others who've had the fortune to be his
students ) An Inspiration to thoroughly love and enjoy what I am
doing... to dedicate my life to something worthwhile... to be
uncompromising on the quality of work I do. Though I've failed
miserably in learning any amount of Math from him, I feel
privileged to have been his student.

and Madhusudhan was my bench-mate in there! I didn't speak much to
him there, [speaking to your neighbors was a sin at that place]
but I'll never forget the Ratna days; Sanskrit/English classes
once in a while, Chemistry Labs, Cycle rides/Walks back from
college along with Veeru and Srinu discussing everything under the
sun and the Krotov solving session in the park. Memories are all,
that remain...

*Disambiguation:* The original Linux on 2 Floppies is here.

I, post this from a remastered version of Knoppix that we named
Floppix!

It all actually began, with me deciding to do a bit of Emacs-ing
at home during the winter hols but I don't have a Linux box at
home. Live-CD is the way to go! But then Emacs doesn't \*usually\*
go with Live-CDs. So I decided to get around making my own. :)
[Dunnet "Dunnet Game"),
an Adventure game in Emacs, played a crucial role in motivating me
to go ahead!] The rest as they say is history....

Actually, I tried a debootstrap from my Debian etch but I couldn't
manage to get the initrd working. [[http://avudem.blogspot.com
"Voodoo"][I ain't this geekish, its only that I am incapable of
putting these terms in a simpler language.] After numerous futile
attempt, I gave up for the time being and that's when the genius
of [Voodoo]] came in, he took a different route. Remastering
Knoppix.[Modifying an existing Live-CD of Knoppix]

I won't get into the exact details of how we got about it. There's
a lot of online help available for that.

A few highlights, for the curious reader...

- got rid of the default KDE and replaced it with
  Fluxbox. [actually Floppix = Fluxbox + Knoppix :P]
- added emacs, cmucl, slime, octave, linuxdcpp, vlc and others.
- got rid of other packages which we weren't going to use.
- changed the boot message
- changed the default background image.
- removed the default boot image [ couldn't change it as the image
  we chose wasn't being properly converted to lss16 format ]
- tested the CD with Qemu [size of the iso got more than 700MB]
- removed a few other not so regularly used packages [including
  wine!]
- burnt the CD
- Logged in!

Now, that I've logged in, I realize we managed to quite a decent
job. Obviously we weren't perfect. It was the first time and done
in quite a hurry. [btw, we have our end-sems going on; I've no
exam tomorrow though] I was able to listen to music, connect to
the DC, play a game of dunnet and make a blogpost! We also missed
a few packages, for instance a screen shot capture program! But it
ain't too bad, still a long way to go though!

Just hoping we manage to make it better, as we get better at it!
;)

Here comes FloppixV0.1!


-----

Update [3/1/08]: I never knew that GIMP could capture screenshots!
ImageMagick can do that too. I had two programs at hand and
thought I had none! Here's a Screenshot of the Floppix Desktop.

file:../../images/floppix_desktop.jpg

Picture Source [for the Background Image] : 9

-----

Update 2 [4/1/08]: There is already a floppy distro of Linux
called Floppix. I knew about this only when some one searching for
it reached my blog. Guess I should do something about this. [I'll
be able to do it only after getting back to campus,though]

Another post, with nothing concrete to say...

- These are just a few random musings, for those curious about my
  life and for the good health of my Blog which is so close to its
  death..
- College (+ Hostel) is amongst few places, that everyone on
  Earth(& elsewhere) \*must\* get the chance to be in. There's a
  whole new world out here, with hell a lotuva things you can do,
  Here and Only Here... [I am not, by any means, talking of
  acads!]
- Projects. Yes they are a part of almost all my random
  stuff... cos I just Love them, when they are self-assigned and
  off-hand. They get even more exciting, when the learning curve
  is Steep!
- Deadlines can be wonderful things, if only I learn to respect
  them.
- Lab-Tests, i guess, are amongst the most hyped tests in the
  World! They aren't worth all that fuss.
- Grades ain't everything in Life. Not even if you are doing
  Engineering!
- I live amidst /wonderful* singers, *marvelous* music composers,
  *facile* lyric writers, *cool* Hackers, *amazing* photographers,
  *inspiring* poets and what not. [Why the hell do people then,
  look just for the *"industrious"/ grade scorers?]
- Music and Sleep are Great Healers. Laughter, too, is a close
  competitor.
- GNU/Linux is addictive. More n more people getting addicted,
  everyday!
- RHCE's got a pretty interesting test. Its rare to be interested
  in undergoing the torture of a test, ain't it?
- Rules seem to be total crap, until you get the chance to look at
  them from above.
- Quark'08 coming up! Gottu gear up for it!
- Comprees?? They don't bother me so much any more.
- Finally, for those who found all the above stuff boring and
  dumb... here's some food for thought > The Best things in Life

As I start this post, the rear-part of my body aches, after a nice
thrashing from the hostel junta. Apparently this is my gift on
having incremented my account of revolutions, around a big ball of
gases. (The total now moves on to 20) [isn't this apparent credit,
really a debit?] It was more than compensated for, with a lovely
cake though.

I just want to thank all the junta, [relatives and friends and
enemies and everyone else], who love me for what I am, even if all
they get back is stupidity, imperfection, insincerity, hypocrisy
and all sorts of crap. Thanks to everyone who pray for me to grow,
up and not just old. Thanks a Million.

A couple of decades through, and still no idea where life's taking
me. Isn't LIFE an opportunity that we need to make the most out
of?

Just hoping, this year gives me some wisdom, a little courage and
a lot more love to make the most of this opportunity.

*Caution*: This post is just some arbit crap, that arose from some
 internal probing. Its utterly worthless for any reader other than
 myself. This could possibly even be classified narcissistic or
 whatever that's called.

Presently, I've got tests going on and they are half way
through. Considering this and the fact that its been over a month
since I last posted, writing a post now doesn't make much sense,
does it?[If my blog's been dormant so long, can't it be so for a
couple of days more?] But things I've been up to off-late, don't
make much sense. [in the past, at least they made sense to me if
not to others.] This post is just about that, going from being
senseless to at least being less sense [and hopefully, to being
sensible]

I've screwed up the tests so far, and don't think will be doing
much better in the others too. Even otherwise, I haven't done
anything good, anything that feels great, anything that feels
right, in the past couple of months (years?? decades??) [except
for one video with 'the gang', i didn't contribute much
though]. Let alone accomplishing something nice, I haven't even
been attempting anything decent enough. My priorities have gone
haywire, or may be not, may be I'm just doing things that are very
low on the scale or may be I'm not doing anything, things are just
hapenning.

- I've slept through 'n' classes both inside and outside the
  classroom
- I've stayed awake all night downloading some crap for my comp.
- I had been worrying about keeping my blog alive. Made numerous
  attempts to post something, even if its no big deal not posting
  regularly.
- Changed 4 different OSes in a couple of days!
- been ages since I last visited the Library.
- Slept through the morning lotsa times, even if I enjoy EBER-ing
- Bunked bathing just because i'll have more clothes to wash!

The list is pretty long. It ain't sensible to be putting down the
whole thing here.</ul> I guess I've just been trying to escape
things. Running from doing important stuff. I've had enough. Its
high time I do something about it. I've decided to get in control
of my life, rather than being controlled by arbit stuff like
sleep, a blog, a grade, an addiction, a song, a cricket match, a
rain, a meal, a game of carrom, a prof's accent, a course, a test
or other such trivialities.

I wish to get back on track!!

..to get back into the habit of doing things I love, at the time
and place I like.

..to doing things that give me joy, in the true sense. Not
momentary, passing pleasures.

Hopefully, with some effort, I will. (A nudge is all it takes.)

btw, if this post was a total bouncer, this is for you....

First things first...

स्वतंत्रता दिनोत्सव की शुभकामनायें

Wish You All a Happy Independence Day..

స్వాతంత్ర  దినోత్సవ  శుభాకాంక్షలు...

[yes, I know just three of the eighteen... and no foreign ones.. ]

Every year, during this time of the year, the papers and news and
blogs and all other such media, are filled with analyses,
comments, opinions and all sorts of things on the progress made
(and not made) by Independent India.... the flavour of patriotism
that was only subtle all this while, tends to grow upon us as the
Day arrives and I'm no exception.

Being an average Indian, just one amongst the Billion, the
progress (or non-) is a very big issue for me to comment on and I
would leave that job for the better qualified or the more
courageous ones. But I wonder, I (just) wonder.....

Come August and its the beginning of a new semester, bringing
along "Elections" in campus. This time is no different... I can
see people gearing up.... campaigning has begun even before the
announcement of elections or nominations... and what goes on here?

- "Dude.. I don't need to campaign.. there's enough guys from our state in our hostel.. so contesting= winning.. don't worry!"
- "Look dude.. both of us are from the same state.. so I know you will be obviously voting for me.. but still if you want, you can have a look at my Agenda... "
- "Hey, its not important for me to tell you my agenda... its sufficient for you to know that my opponent hails from the other half of the country (North-South)where we hail from..
- "People.. we need to make sure that only one person, belonging to our state contests for this post... or the votes will get divided"

Where are those ideals of unity and brotherhood? Isn't it
important that the best person be chosen? Shouldn't the abilities
of a candidate be considered rather than where (s)he hails from or
what tongue (s)he speaks? Isn't it an irony, that all this happens
precisely during this time, when the whole nation is celebrating
the birth of an Independent India?? Shouldn't at least the
celebrations be able to evoke the emotions of brotherhood, love
and equality amongst us?? Shouldn't the fact that all of us are
here with a purpose, a common goal of education, enough to get
over the differences of language and origin? Shouldn't the
interests of the College and the Students overpower such minor
issues??

These days my strolls, in the blog-o-sphere, have grown manifold
both in their numbers and lengths. And with every passing
step... self doubts mount up. I begin to wonder if my blogs even
worth its w8 in 'seconds'. Like the thousands of others in this
world, I could post something in one of these genres but..

- Techno Blog. [On various latest hardware, softwares, gadgets et
  al..] But I ain't a geek to be able to post such stuff. If I
  ever posted something of this genre.. it would just be a
  copy-paste job.. isn't of any great value, given the readership
  of my blog.
- Scientific Blog. [With the latest advances in various
  disciplines of Science] Again a case similar to the previous
  one. Not of much use
- Literary Blog.[Stories n Poems n other Creations.] I ain't a
  creative being and rarely indulge in such creative acts. Would
  be foolish
- PhotoBlog.[Creative Pics/Paintings, Worthy of Display] I own no
  camera and don't borrow one too often. Also haven't got a very
  Creative eye to capture magic from the ordinary. Un-healthy
- Daily Diary. [An account of my day-to-day tidings] My life ain't
  overflowing with adventures. I am presently leading a
  non-adventurous, pretty monotonous life that would be
  uninteresting to readers of all classes. Ruled out for the lack
  of utility.
- Current-affairs Blog. [An account of today's, this week's
  happenings] Not interested in being a Journalist, there's
  already lotsa people who can handle the job better.
- Humour Blog. [Laugh and Let Laugh!] Again there's a lot of it
  already online, and with a sense of humour like mine, the
  difference made would be Nought.
- Inspirational Blog. [Inspire others to do their best.] Its
  pointless preaching what I don't practice. That would be
  hypocrisy.
- Information Blog. [Any info possibly..from pet-care to ethnic
  goan recipes...] I haven't yet crammed in so much into the
  super-computer on my top-floor to beat Google.
- A Mixed Bag. [Posts of multiple genres] Impossible. The bag's
  already empty for every item of it has already been ruled out.

Do I still need a BLOG?

ps: Prevention of boredom-induced-insanity is the one and only
genuine reason(known to me) for the continued existence of my
blog.

Note: This post isn't of much use to others (may be the same with
other posts too.. :P) Just a few ramblings of the 2 month stay @
Delhi.... (allegedly doing a Project!)

- All Scientists ain't /Scientists/
- There's nothing *BIG* about Research papers... [You can do
  all sorts of things in there... something like the TOI
  comparison of Sachin and the Sensex... ;)]
- The "Hacker Culture" ought to be adopted (or atleast something
  closer to it..) at *Research* organisations.. [I thoroughly
  hated the hypocritical behaviour of the people at my PS.. ]
- Of all the people, the guy I found closest to being a
  *hacker* [w.r.t technical skills] was the guy operating the
  Photocopier... [this could well be a case of poor observation or
  under-estimation, but that's what I feel right now.. ]
- Perfectionists manage to be /imperfect at the perfect/
  time...
- Need to develop the ability to *talk* crap!(not just type
  in.. ) [comes in quite handy.. ]
- I loved EBERing all these days.. got to keep it
  going. [jaanees.. need some help in this.. ;) ]
- Loooong walks are great fun... [anybody game??]
- I ain't a very Creative being...
- I ought to learn to be more tolearant to using Windows, I
  guess.. [It was a real pain using it...]
- My Will power (for doing stuff that I hate.. ) has tremendously
  increased!! Thanks to the one and only....
- Any project that's not *my* choice will inevitably turn out to
  be a /Projest/ [can't say much abt the others.. ;)]
- Hostel in Coll is ulti cool.. don't ever dare compare any other
  one with it..
- and found this cool pic... [I guess I need to follow him.. ;)]

Yes, that's what my PS's been like.. It hasn't turned out to be as

#+begin_quote
Nowadays, there's a certain danger of the same thing
happening, even in the famous field of physics. I was shocked to
hear of an experiment being done at the big accelerator at the
National Accelerator Laboratory, where a person used deuterium. In
order to compare his heavy hydrogen results to what might happen
with light hydrogen, he had to use data from someone else's
experiment on light hydrogen, which was done on a different
apparatus. When asked why, he said it was because he couldn't get
time on the program (because there's so little time and it's such
expensive apparatus) to do the experiment with light hydrogen on
this apparatus because there wouldn't be any new result. And so
the men in charge of programs at NAL are so anxious for new
results, in order to get more money to keep the thing going for
public relations purposes, they are destroying -- possibly -- the
value of the experiments themselves, which is the whole purpose of
the thing. It is often hard for the experimenters there to
complete their work as their scientific integrity
demands.

When I first read this {from Feynman's Cargo Cult Science [Adapted
from a Caltech commencement address in 1974]}, I couldn't quite
figure out what or how exactly things are happening and what
exactly Feynman meant by "losing the value of experiments". But,
now I know.. thanks to my PS. A lot of stuff that goes on
here..[at least from what I can see..] is quite similar to (in
fact worse than) this. PS's been absolutely disappointing.. I
don't think I've learnt anything here that's worth the effort of
spending my hols (too), away from home...  [except for Awe-TEM] I
don't think I will be taking back anything with me..  other than
may be, a knowledge of stuff that I shouldn't learn, stuff that I
should keep away for the rest of my life...

Feynman is saying this to *me*, Right now!

I am beginning to notice something about my posts [ok.. there
aren't many that make it here.. :P] There are sometimes, when I
feel I should write about a specific thing. I feel as if, there
has to be a post about this, and there's no way I can't write
about it.

But then I have limited access to net here... and even less time
when I'm alone, to write up something. I definitely cannot access
net immediately, whenever I get that 'feel' to write about
something. So the post is postponed...  And later, when I think
about it, or do get access to net... it seems that topic isn't
worth writing.. or that 'feel' isn't there anymore..

I wonder if this would have been the case with my other posts
too.. if only I waited longer to post them?? [But on reading some
of the older posts I don't feel so much that way...] Am I being
lazy?? [Is this how other blogs die down?] Is it that my life is
dull and boring here (if it was so bad.. I guess I would've
managed to write about boredom! :P).. and there's nothing worth
writing? [and I am just thinking of something to keep my blog
alive?]  Is my blog closer to its end than it is to its beginning?
[I don't think so.. its only a matter of time before I get back to
coll.. :P] But is it the best way to be posting
[instinctively... immediately]??? Or is there something better
that I should be learning.. that I should have learnt by now??

BTW.. why do people blog at all?? What's the whole point of
Blogging? [Yes, I haven't still understood what it is.. even after
about 30 posts...]

Writing from Delhi, doing my PS at NPL! One would imagine, that I
am here enjoying myself; that I am enjoying thoroughly the
exposure I am getting to the world of Physics at a Research Level;
that I am spending each moment, inspired. But things haven't been
so rosy here... until today! [All this while I had been only doing
a lot of mechanical labor, very unhappily...]

Its around 12 noon, when I get a call, in the lab, from my guide
asking me to come down to room no. so and so. I had no idea what
that room had, or why I had been called. I enter and I am lead to
another room inside. I enter and there's a huge machine. (first
look, reminded me of Vickers' Hardness Testing Machine, that we
had in Lab at coll and I had a test on using it!) and its called a
TEM. But when I got closer, I fell in love with it! I dunno how
and why, but it looked simply amazing and extremely lovely to me
[Nothing like the Vickers' machine]. A 25 to 30 year old machine,
lots of controls all over it, lots of circuitry out in the
open... absolutely awe-inspiring..[though I knew nothing about
them.]

And then came the moment. The lights in the room were turned off,
and slowly and steadily the beam intensity of the TEM was
increased. Gradually the Greenish Fluoroscent Screen (displaying a
sample magnified X27,000) came to life... with control lights
blinking here and there... in the darkness of the room.It was
absolutely amazing; A great feeling. Though I was in there for a
very short while... an absolutely unforgettable experience; and
will remain so, for the rest of my life.

Now, it doesn't matter to me even if I don't learn much, during
the training period, I don't mind doing any kind-of mechanical
work, I don't mind not getting any results from my work,
whatever... it doesn't matter any more. This one moment; that's
all that matters.

  franchises.. all over the State}
- A : How did your neighbor's cousin's friend's daughter's friend
  do? [ob exaggerated] B : She didn't do quite well. It seems she
  didn't study the I yr syllabus properly!! {How did he ever get
  to know that?!!?!?}
- Me : Where's A? Why's he so late? J.H : His sister's Medicine
  results are out. She scored 700! A local rank of 10! She'll get
  into any place she chooses. Me : That's cool. So that guys gone
  for a party or what? J.H : No he's consoling his sister! She's
  weeping for she expect to score a rank close to 300! Me : Oh
  c'mon!!

Why the hell is the whole state dragged into this? Can't the guys
n gals be left alone? Why is that a little thing as a test that
allocates various grad seats to the students, blown out of
proportion? Do we need big Corporate giants fighting for the ranks
and cash of aspiring students? Why all the hue and cry??

Isn't is possible for these people to have a normal life, where
these CET's are just a part of their lives and not their LIVES
themselves? Can't they be doing other things along with preparing
to get into a good grad school? Do we wish to have Engineers and
Doctors who, all through the best couple of years of their lives,
were busy grinding, swallowing and puking out heaps and heaps of
books just to get one seat in a Grad School?

Will things ever be normal again? When will kids "here" start
being kids? When will the parents and teachers and all the zillion
others understand that their kids need to be given everything in
life, exposed to everything. Not just dumping in gallons of
formulae and tons of equations. Will people ever give CETs just
that much attention as it deserves, and not make it a big issue
all over the state? When will the EAMCET stop being the lives of
college students and start being just a part of their lives??

[I have tried my best to portray the situation, in this part of
the World. But it is quite possible that I didn't do it well
enough....]

“... no one is never really alone. Even when there is not other perso around, there still must be someone. Someone who made you  and therefore cares what happens to you.

Exam time now. Sleep time cut-down! [already compensated for,
during the whole semester! :D] Getting up quite early during these
days.... [To cram in something at the last minute.. :P]

But all that kept aside, I feel great to be waking up early in the
morning. Watching the Sun rise.. is a great feeling. The calm of
the dawn, the chirping of the birds n the cool breeze.. Its
absolutely amazing -- awe inspiring. Its a great experience. A
rare one for me,though.. :( For the last four semesters, I have
been a part of the owl-tribe... staying awake till late in the
night and doing all sorts of stuff... [other than study - during
the non-exam time...] Its great fun staying awake very late in the
night... having fun with friends... B'day parties, Musical
sessions in Ringo's room, Movies, Carrom-Nights, all-night
Chats(online n offline..) and lots of other stuff.

But all this can be done during the day can't it[The fun of doing
it in the night is totally different though..]?? If I enjoy the
morning times so much, shouldn't I be enjoying it more often? If
its such a great feeling.. to be waking up in the morning.. should
I trade it with all the fun I have, late in the night?? Is it
worth it? Like Voodoo believes, should I put in efforts to enjoy
the sunrise each day??  Is it time.. that I try out the
cliche... "Early to Bed, Early to Rise..." [EBER -- that's what UC
calls it... and hence the title... :P]

cut-down so much on their sleep, and work so hard, I wonder how
much is possible for *LOVE*. I think this is the thing that drives

I was just wondering, a couple of nights ago, at dinner.. "When
did I first decide that I would be doing Engineering?" The answer
-- I don't know...  All I know is that, during my High schooling I
was more interested in Maths and Science {Physics specially...}
Then I did what most just-out-of-school kids with an interest in
Math &amp; Science do {specially in that part of the world where I
live, Andhra Pradesh} Took up Math.Phys.Chem in intermediate and
prepare for Engg. entrance tests alongside. After failing to get a
rank that would fetch me an *Engg. course* in any of the IITs, I
landed here..

Then the choice of discipline, that was just based on popular
opinion and luck [called preferential allotment...] and I finally
ended up in EEE.

But the question is when did I make that choice of becoming a
so-called Engineer? Did I ever consider the alternatives and make
a decision? If yes, then when?? What kind of an engineer did I
choose to become? Did I make the choice of becoming an electrical
engineer??

I think, I never knew what kind of an Engineer I wanted to be.[
with the knowledge of an average School pass out..., you wouldn't
expect one to know all about the various fields of Engineering.] I
think, I never even exactly knew [and don't do so now...], what it
means to be an Engineer. An *Electrical and Electronics Engineer*.

But isn't it important that we the future "Engineers" of the
Country, know what it means to be one and what is expected of us?
Isn't that knowledge essential, for taking a decision to do
engineering.. and also to make the most out of the Engineering
programme?

I wonder what field {or profession or whatever you call that...} I
would choose, if I were given a chance now... [i.e after a couple
of years in an Engineering College...]... I wonder which
discipline I would choose after getting this little insight into
the various fields in Engineering... I wonder what I would choose,
if I get this chance, a couple of years later... or five years
later... :D

Engineering is a great profession. There is the fascination of
watching a figment of the imagination emerge through the aid of
science to a plan on paper. Then it moves to realization in stone
or metal or energy. Then it brings homes to men or women. Then it
elevates the standard of living and adds to the comforts of
life. This is the engineer's high privilege. -- Herbert Hoover

* DONE Presentation or Tribulation?? :blab:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: presentation-or-tribulation
:EXPORT_DATE: 2007-04-28T05:42:00+05:30
:END:




This semester [2-2] I had to give two presentations! As if that
was not enough trouble, the courses were (Principles of)
Management [POM] and (Theory of) Relativity [ThoR] !! The former
was with a group and the latter was an individual affair.. Each
one had its Trials and Tribulations... But at the end of each, I
feel equally foolish. None of them were worth the efforts...

The POM (a course whose reason for existence most of us fail to
understand) presentation was specially torturous to our group. We
had 8 members in our group, but to no avail. Nobody, other than
Bubbly, was bothered about it until we were neck deep. With just 3
days left for the last day to submit the Report/Soft copy, our
frantic searches began. We finally landed on an interesting topic,
A Case Study on AMUL... We started work only on the night before
the submission day... But the interest and excitement, [along with
deadline.. :P] got us through with amazing speed. All of us, were
through with our parts of the job before going to bed. The next
morning, I along with 9 put together everything, almost ready to
be submitted. But fate had other plans for us... The topic we
worked on was rejected! Reason:There's already a group working on
it!!

Back to square one... we began the search again. After much effort
we found a couple of topics and approached her for
approval. Though the topics weren't damn interesting.. they were
something we would've liked to work on. But all we get is another
rejection and a Magazine that had a ready-made case study! We were
supposed to speak on operations management[o.m] in a cosmetic
multinational! [2 days, to work on some *#&amp;$# cosmetic firm!
Worasht!! Imagine writing a Report on a Presentation on a Report
in a Journal... and that too on a Cosmetic Company!!] The last
nail on the coffin was hit. We felt hopeless and work didn't start
again till the night before the D-Day.. Not interested in working
on that cosmetic thingy.. we decided to work on o.m in some other
firm, and HLL seemed a neat choice.

After slogging through the whole of the next morning, we somehow
managed to get the report ready and finally at 2 pm, me and 9 went
in search of a printer! None was found until 5:30 in the evening!!
Somehow we submitted it finally... Phew!

But that's not the end of the story. There was a lot more in store
for us. The presentation date. We were given a date, on which to
give the presentation, but couldn't give it on that day, for too
many people were called and there was too little time... Hats off
to our Ma'am for such wonderful managerial skills. We had to beg
her to allow us to present it on a date convenient to all of
us.[She insisted that we do it on a particular date, when we
already had other appointments!?!!] Finally, she agreed. Phew!

On the D-day, 8 people, 40 mins... it was fun! There wasn't enough
time left for my turn and so I hurried through my part, the
conclusion.... But,the best part of it all was that, even a
half-hearted, just-for-the-sake-of-it effort could impress her!!
The presentation passsed off as a "very good presentation"! [Not
"yaxcellent!", though]

Then the Relativity one! I had to speak on Kerr Black
Holes. I hadn't heard of them until one day Dr. A.K. Biswas gave
me the topic, and asked me to speak on it, after he finishes
teaching Schwarzchild Black Holes. It was all fine, until there
was just a week left for the Compre's to start and he didn't start
teaching about Black Holes!! This Monday he asked me when I was
going to give my talk. Hoping that he would teach at least a small
part of it during the last week, I chose Friday. [Even at the cost
of ruining my comprees..] But, he didn't even tell us what Black
holes were, leave alone discussing the Schild Black Hole. I was
trying my bit to work my way through it but 3 days were too few to
read all about static Black Holes and then move on to Rotating
ones! I had a tough time.. but tried my best to make head and tail
of it. Finally today, I thought I understood a decent part of it
and was ready to present it before the class.

After an unsteady and slow start, I managed to put across a few
points about Black Holes in general and the Kerr Geometry.  But
then, I wasn't very comfortable with the other parts of what I had
to present, and this clearly reflected in my talk. It was growing
dumber and dumber... So, Sir stopped and asked me if I was going
to present the Penrose Diagram, and I said no. Thankfully he
understood my situation and asked me what I wanted to present and
asked me to finish it off with a few of the simpler things. I
jabbered something and was done with it. Phew!

But what was the result of all this drama? Were the results
in proportion to the efforts put in? Were the presentations really
worth the effort?  If the intention of these presentations was to
increase the Knowledge base of the class, I think we achieved
nothing. If we were supposed to enlighten the class, then we
failed in a big big way. But if the intention was to increase our
own knowledge base, I would say we succeeded in a very small
way... There definitely are much more efficient ways to increase
our own knowledge base. So is there any other purpose for such
talks??

A final few things... [I know you are wondering why I wrote this
post. Such a long one. I don't know....]

1.  It would've been better had the topic change been in ThoR and
    not in POM. I should have spoken on Black Holes in general and
    Schwarzchild Black Holes. Not Kerr Black Holes.
2.  The two people who guided us/me in the Presentations had
    contrasting opinion on the Internet! Our Ma'am considered the
    Internet to be a Devil [or some such thing] She doesn't like
    the fact that people get info for their presentations from the
    net. [Why? we haven't figured out yet] Journals are god-like
    for her!! Unlike her, our Dr.Biswas is quite respectful of
    this wonderful tool.. the Internet.
3.  None of these presentations were comparable [in terms of
    energy,excitement and fun we had!] to our last sem's
    presentation, "Copyleft". Is it because Copyleft wasn't a
    course related topic?? :P
4.  Giving a Technical presentation is tough. Its even worse if
    you are speaking on topic that you are studying just for the
    sake of the presentation.
5.  The presentations were rated as good, even if I know they were
    no where close to what a Real Presentation should be like. POM
    -- bcos Ma'am thought we used the journal she gave us!! ThoR
    -- to encourage us to put in greater efforts.
6.  I'm not very good at giving presentations...

Pray for me brother

Lookin' for the answers To all the questions In my life
Will I be alone Will you be there By my side
Is it something he said Is it something he did
I wonder why He is searchin’ For the answers
To stay alive

Could you ever listen Could you ever care
To speak your mind
Only for a minute For only one moment
In time

The joy is around us But show me the love
That we must find
Are you searchin' For a reason to be kind, to be kind…

Pray for me brother Pray for me sister

But keep your hearts open

Don't let me take When you don’t wanna give
Don't be afraid Just let me live
Don't let me take When you don’t wanna give
Don't be afraid Say what you wanna say now
But keep your hearts open

Be what you wanna be now Let's heal the confusion
Pray for me brother Pray for me brother
I'm ashamed ah, brother be dying of poverty
when he down on his knees its only then he prays
And it's a shame ah, brother be dying of ignorance
cos the world is a trip and everybody’s a hypocrite
Need to stop ah , taking a look at the other
I'm not ashamed of poverty
need to be making his life better
So think about it, think about it once more
cos life is a blessing and it's not justa show, ah
Round and round the world is spinning around

We need to be singing a prayer, we need to be singing it now
Round and round the world is turning around
We need to be singing a prayer, we need to be singing it now
Need to be feeling the power, need to be feeling the faith
We need to coming together just to win this race

Need to be feeling the power, need to be feeling the faith
We need to coming together just to win this race (twice)
Are you searching for a reason to be kind ?

A few days back.. we [the usual gang of Ringo,9,UC,Vudum n
me.. along with a lot of others who joined us later] were in the
park, just relaxing and having a chat... but with the others
joining us [with whom I usually don't hang around..] , the topics
discussed were quite different from those that interest me...and
we usually talk on..  I was getting bored.. but suddenly an
interesting idea popped up... the funda of living on CS.. [though
the tone in which they looked at the idea was different... I found
it interesting..]

The ppl were criticizing a guy (don't wanna name him :P) {who
hosted wierd maps with soccer and other such stuff in it..}.. the
people were imagining wild things like.. maps in which class-notes
would be read out/scrolled... maps where food items would be
displayed at lunch time.. etc.. This might look like a funny and
weird idea.. (that gave us all a nice laugh..) but it doesn't seem
ridiculous or crazy to me.. the very fact that the idea was
conceived, annihilates it ridiculousness, for me. Though such a
degree of dependence (and addiction??) may be an over exaggeration
but...

A walk in the hostel corridors any time during the night will tell
you why i say this... I can see people in every room... (literally
every one.. and mind you I am no exception to this..) stuck to
their comps doing all sorts of things... [actually not a wide
range.. its pretty predictable... :-(] and now after my comp's
network card got burnt out (...probably... thanks to the lack of
grounding in hostels) I can see it even more clearly... that
computers are ruling our lives... [at this point.. I'm confused
why I started writing this... what's it that's bugging me? I'm
definitely not against ppl using Comps.. for I love them...]

Is it that it pains me to see people use comps for stuff that's
not so technical? Does it hurt me that we have such "Powerful"
machines before us.. and all we do with them is trivial things
like chat with others or play? I don't think so... Yes, when I
read the book Hackers:Heroes of the Computer Revolution, I felt
ashamed of using my comp in a meek and powerless way... but then I
realise that they were the Hackers from the Hacker land .. and
everyone can't be one, can they? Then what's it, that bugs me?

I guess I miss the time we spent in the first (and a little of
second) semester... when very few people had comps. We had a great
time... doing other activities that were more physical... and
refreshing (than sitting in front of a comp and posting
this!!).. I miss those football tourneys we had in the
quadrangles.. I miss those "leg" cricket matches... I long for
something like the Wrestling match we [Vudum, Ravi,Thatha n me]
had in my room... I miss those thermo sessions with Vudum n
Ravi.. I miss the tuts in Ravi's room... (mind you we sometimes
studied even when there weren't exams!!) I guess I miss a lotta
things from the first sem... The time at dinner and the chats in
parks, are the only things that are still intact... [ I wouldn't
dare forget to mention our recent trip to the woods near the
lake... it was awesome!! something that we'll all cherish for
life...] I just hope we have more and more and such
moments... moments that i will cherish for life... moments.. that
"we" will cherish for life...

*Update*: I just saw Ringo's old cd of Illayaraja songs... and
 realised, I forgot to mention the wonderful time we
 [Ringo,9,Hari,UC n me..] had listening to them in Ringo's room on
 a CD player... and Ringo's mouthorgan!!!

PS stands for Practice School...

I would've titled this post, "NPL... here I come!!" but for all
this...

It all began with an unannounced letter from the PS
division... giving us just 5 days time to fill up our "PS-1"
forms... with Waves round the corner.. this was too short a
notice.. and the panic button was pressed.. and pressed real
hard!! {lots of heated discussion.. frantic google
searches.. repeated calls to/from home.. etc were kicked off...}

Then, the filling up of on-line forms... [oh you thought.. online
forms were a cakewalk?? even i thought so.. until this!!] We had
to fill a priority list of 214 items.. flat... That was not the
big problem... We had a not so well developed form handler...[i'm
probably being unfair to the developers...because the server also
caused quite a few problems... but that's the least i can say...]
I know of people.. who learnt their options by-heart... thanks to
the wonderful system and the server, that made them fill the whole
list 4 to 5 times..

Then there was this headache of filling up everything in
ink... [one of the rare ocassions.. other than reports for MT n
Mu-P... when i wrote so much.. and felt it all useless...]

Then, a meeting organised by seniors to "help" us choose
PS[Practice School] stations... noble intentions.. but i ended up
being more confused!! [After telling all the good stuff.. they
came down to the point that staying close to home.. is the best
thing to do.. this put me in soup!]

All this is nothing when compared to the "declaration of results"
(it wasn't any exam.. to call the allotment.. results.. but the
use of these words is intentional...)  First, there was an April
fool attempt by one of the students... it was quite cleverly
planned but the little error of sending everyone the same
password.. ended the whole thing tamely.. but it dindn't go for
nothing.. it was successful in rebuilding the stage... people
began discussing the topic..

After a wait of 4 days... the D-day finally arrived... and people
went crazy!! As if the excitement wasn't enough.. the PSD added
its bit.. the results weren't sent to everyone at once.. they sent
it one by one, discipline-wise... (god only knows how they managed
the feat[around 1400 students!!], manually) People were eagerly
waiting for the results... a world cup final would have been no
match... F5 keys on all the keyboards took a beating... People
shouting wildly!! (both in delight and rage..).. There was quite a
lot of Drama...

Now after the reality has sunk in... its a bit cooler... but still
quite humid.. every talk inevitably is leading just to this... a
lot of analysis, discussions and post-mortem going on.... happy
about their partners/collegues... people getting angry with
others(both for discussing and not discussing about
it..)... unhappy with partners... phew! a lot of action all around
the place... [It's as if a sleeping Giant has just been woken
up...]

After all this hype and ballyhoo.. i just hope the PS stands up to
something... I mean.. I hope I stand up to it.... and do
something.. some small bit of work.. that'll keep me hooked for a
couple of months.. something that'll be worth thinking of later on
in life... something that'll be worth posting abt...:-P
ok!.... "NPL... Here I come...!!"

A couple of days back.. one guy called green_mamba asked me.. "Why
do you use Linux (GNU/Linux) and not Windows? What is it that
makes LinuxGNU/Linux] so special for you?" I avoided that
question then.. {I was in no mood of answering questions... Exams
had finished just the day before!!}  I am trying to answer it
now... green_mamba also told me that Roopesh said, "I use it
because I can look at the source code. I am allowed to look at how
things work and fiddle with the way they work!"... I knew it
immediately that this was not the reason for me.[I rarely looked
at source code... and making changes to it.. haha..] So what is
it? I think I can answer this question if I get back to the time
when I started using Linux...[hehe.. not too long ago!! :P]

So how did I start using GNU/Linux? How did "we" first meet? It
was during last summer holidays.. that Voods sent me this link
... [I had definitely used GNU/Linux on a few occasions
before... but.. this was when I really began using it...] and
within hours I was a fan of GNU/Linux!![and Richard M Stallman

So its the "philosophy"... The philosophy of Free
Software... [Free as in Freedom, not as in Free Beer...(English is

  oneness [this can't happen with Windows.. because you can't
  share stuff... :-(]
- I have begun to hate the concept of Proprietary Software... can
  you believe that.. "Sharing stuff..  makes us PIRATES!!"

- I am a growing fan of the Command Line... It simply rocks!!

- There's almost no problem of Viruses/Malware.. You simply don't
  need an Anti-Virus..(that needs to be updated every night.. or
  u'll have nightmares...)

- Then there's this wonderful concept of Live-CDs.. {specially
  Knoppix.. Its absolutely awesome!} It put me(us?) out of
  soup... a lotta times...

- The fiddle factor... I have just started to fiddle with
  things(...source codes... I added a small feature to my
  dc-client Microdc2].. the feature of away messages.. it feels
  gr8! :P)

- One of my best friend is using it too! [you know who...]

- The Mascot looks cool!! ;) [I liked the GNU mascot too! (It's on
  my side-bar) ]

- The name "LINUX"!! [There's so many flavors(Distros) of
  Linux.. that I can keep trying different ones.. all my
  life :P.. presently with Slackware!]

- Its Fun!! and I want to use it...

- and finally... Windows sucks! [I don't have to use it... :P]!!

There's a post already with 'exactly' this name.... by 9... here...
But this post doesn't have much to do with his post... [or may be it does??]

Here's a Quote on Mahatma Gandhi...
/Generations to come, it may be, will scarcely believe that such a
one, as this, ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth. --
Albert Einstein/

I was just wondering.... what would happen if the name Albert
Einstein was replaced by punchagan... and it turned out
that.. there's a huge huge list of candidates for replacing
Mahatma Gandhi... [This is with due respect to the Mahatma and
Einstein.. I don't, in any sense, intend to say that the Mahatma
was not a Mahatma...]

All I want to say is... I am seeing a whole lot of new things, in
people around me, that inspire awe and respect in me... that every
person is unique... every person is special.. every person can
teach you something.... there's something to learn from
everyperson... that makes me believe God,truly, created man in his
own image...

I am grateful to all the people around me (and those not around
any more..)... who have shown, are showing, and will be showing me
things bright and beautiful... wise and wonderful... which
otherwise I would have failed to see..

I am grateful... for getting me back on track.. when i go
directionless,.. for setting me examples to emulate,... for being
with me whenever i needed and will need you...

[ I would've loved to write down each and every name here.... but
that's too big a job for this little being to achieve... ]


As William Arthur Ward says....

#+begin_quote
Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present
and not giving it.

To All Jaani's of the World... Thanks a Lot... (I know that's too
small a word... but that's all I can give right now...)

had made, and indeed it was very good."/ Gen 1:27, 31

loyal, through whom you are blessed, and for whom you are
grateful.”  -- William Arthur Ward

In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is
then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We
should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner

A few days back I received a letter from a friend, via post! [I
know most of you can't believe this... but ya.. its true..] I
wouldn't have believed it too... if only he didn't tell that to me
when we met online... {He spoilt the fun for me! :-(} So before
going to dinner one day...(a couple of weeks back..).. I checked
out the Hostel Assistants room for any post.... and "it" was right
on top of the pile!! [Now that I speak of a pile don't imagine
that a lot of people here get personal letters... most of them
were business correspondence, magazines or likewise...]
Neways.. it was a great feeling to even look at it!! A white
envelope... and my name on it.. in his most familiar writing on
it...[no.. i don't get letters from him often.. we have been
classmates for quite some time.. so...] ... the stamp [A leapard
cat!]... and the two postmarks.. [of Pilani &amp;
Zuarinagar!! :-P]... Holding the letter in my hand.. it felt
wonderful!! [I wanted to read it right then.... but went along for
dinner...]

After dinner... and a little time in the Children's
Park... [relaxing.. wid 9,UC,Voodoo n Ringo]... I opened it! It
was absolutely thrilling... to see a couple of pages written in
ink [he still uses ink pens!! ;-)]... With full enthu.. i read the
letter.. and obviously once wasn't enough to satiate my hunger.. i
went through it over and over and over... [i wanted to scribble
down a reply ASAP... but we had waves and quark coming up.. so i
waited for them to get over (I could've written another one
right??)...to get more matter into my letter..]

Why is such a simple joy of getting a letter from a friend [there
is email.. but... for me its nowhere close to snail mail...]
become so rare these days?? [Something that was such a regular
feature of the recent past.. is almost extinct now!!] Telephone
and the Internet.... they are the culprits... (are they??.....) In
today's global village... is post a bit too slow for comfort? Will
survival of the fittest ensure the extiction of this wonderful
species in the world of communication...??

Is a letter just a matter of communication...?... Isn't there
anything more to it... [Obviously there is... otherwise I wouldn't
be writing a blog-post on it...I would never think of writing a
post on an e-mail I get!! (unless it is superhuman.. or
something..)!!] Aren't we losing out on something wonderful??

Revelations..Revelations...Revelations.

Such wonderful things they are... bringing to us.. such a joy
[even if its about something not so pleasant...]... the joy of
discovering things.. of realising a truth... that was hidden
somewhere within... brought out with an elegant swoooosh!!...

We, 9, Voodoo, Ravi, UC n me] were just walking on the
street... enjoying the evening... after a nice day @ Quark [Day
2]... We were having a casual discussion... not discussing
anything in particular... but somehow the discussion led to a
project uc,ravi n me [ and probably the others are too..(they
didn't talk abt it...)] are interested in... [i don't wanna give
any more info abt the project.. bcos it may seem over-ambitious to
a few.. not that it hasn't been done already.... but...]
neways....

so... while we were talkin abt it... uc said, he didn't have any
clue about that thing worked... and we all were wondering
too... thinking about some possible solutions/methods....[I was
actually trying to recollect something i came across... some time
back...] but then suddenly 9 jumped in, to say...

#+begin_quote

its depths... I feel I still haven't come out of it... A big big
revelation at the most unexpected of times, at the most unexpected
of places.... [though 9 wouldn't agree with this... being his
usual modest self...]

Its been proved time and again... "they" can occur
anywhere... anytime and to anyone... while you are on the
street.. in your room.. at work... or even in the loo... [Most ppl

huge spks.. [I can still hear the Music quite loud.. sitting here
in my room.. which is quite a distance form the Venue...] There's
real Heart throbbing music [Literally... With speakers of over
15000W your heart really throbs... dub.. dub.. dub...] being

I was just wondering if we really needed such extravagant
stuff... I know that such events bring ppl together... but do we
need to spend so much money just to have a have a good dance with
friends?? When a large number of people aren't able to get their
basic neccessities like a Square Meal, Clean drinking water,

with friends... with elaborately made extravagant
arrangements... [of course the money isn't ours... but...] [ I
know a lot of guys wud've a lot to say against me.... but.. its
ok..]

There can't be perfect equality in this world... of which duality
is an integral part.... every elementary particle has a dual
nature... so its but obvious that every thing in this world has a
dual to it... so its not possible to have a perfect world with
everybody equally placed.. if there is a rich.. then there will be
a poor... if there is joy.. then there will be despair... if there
is light.. then there will be darkness...

But can't we do anything... can't we spread the light to every
place that we possibly could?? Can't we get together to minimize
the difference? Join the race against nature... do your bit...

Imagine a kid reading Shakespeare's Othello or As You Like
it...[or may be some other classic poem...] with great difficulty
he somehow manages to read the whole thing... [with all the
archaic language etc..] he understands the basic plot and the
story and likes it... but will he be able to appreciate the work?
Will he be able to see the beauty of it?? Isn't a good knowledge
of Language a bare essential for one to enjoy a Literary work??

Now consider a layman... listening to Classical [say Carnatic]
Music... if he's got no knowledge of the Basic structure and
organisation of Music in general or a Raga in particular.. then he
may enjoy the musical work... listen to it happily.... but will he
get the taste of its nectar from the fine intricacies in it??
Isn't a basic sense of Music... a knowledge of the language of
Music necessary to understand the fine points of a Musical piece??

Isn't the case similar with Science [Feynman says nature..]??
Without a proper knowledge base in Mathematics.. how would I
possibly understand and appreciate Physics/Science (in general..)
and Relativity in particular?? [I got this feeling, after class
today, for the zillionth time...] How can I possibly enjoy a
course in Relativity without a proper Math background???

We are less than a week away from our supposedly dreaded
'test-1'... n i have no clue even about what the syllabus is, in
each course... There's 'Theory of Relativity', of which i'm able
to make no head or tail.. then there's 'Electrical Sciences',
which totally "transformed" my plans for this
sem... then...SPM.. muP.. POM... MT.. C&amp;S.........

There are loads and loads of other stuff too...

Relativity... Emacs.... C++... Python... Table Tennis... learning
a bit of Music... picking up practical electronic
skills... reading a few books...(quite a few actually..).. and so
on.... [not to forget.. attending classes... doing a bit of course
related work...]. The list seems only to be growing everyday...

There's nothing that I've crossed out yet.. there's not one thing
that's done to perfection...[with a third of the sem already
through!!] {I already get the feeling.. its "Another sem down the
drain"}

But didn't I begin this sem with plans to "rock" it?? Wasn't I
supposed to attend all the classes that I possible can?? What's it
that I've been doing for the past 5-6 weeks?

I don't know!! I really can't pinpoint what's been achieved in the
past one month or so... [other than of course quite a considerable
amount of sleep.......]

Why are things so horribly out of place?? What's to be done.. to
get on track asap.. I wonder... What should my priorities be? Why
am I being overwhelmed by the things I got to do?

I realise this time of my life is as precious as any
other... (probably more...) and i need to make the most of
it.... but what is that "most"?? [It's definitely not sleep!]

Hi! I'm a bit late...(courtesy:lightning quick network speeds
@coll...{I started this post a couple of weeks back, at
home... and its been rotting all this while, in my drafts!} ) [Its
already time when the resolutions taken just a couple of weeks
back fade away into oblivion... ] but anyways.. Wish You a Very
Happy gNew Year!! oops.. Happy New Year!

Actually this year started of for me not as the usual Happy New
Year.. but as Happy gNew Year! I have been gifted a new PC by my
mom n dad for the new year... and that too an AMD system, (Believe
it or Not..) preloaded with Linux Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4]!
{Its like a fairy tale for me...} Its an AMD Athlon 3200+ with
(512+256)MB RAM and 80GBHDD.... and an awesome 17" TFT Monitor!!

I am happy that my resolutions to have a go at the comp... [ and
use it to the best of my abilities to learn about s/w and
h/w.... to try n imbibe in myself the spirit of true hacking...]
haven't yet gone down the drain! { I've already ripped open the
HCL company seal on my box... and opened it up a couple of times
to fiddle with my HDD and RAM... }

A couple of days after I got the comp... I tried installing
Debian... and being a NooB doesn't help..(does it?).. I messed up
the X-Server...  After some desperate attempts to get the thing
working.. I gave up....... [I had some ebooks etc. downloaded on
my comp at home, which I wished to dump on my comp]. So I
persisted... I tried FC 6 [Fedora Core] .... everything was fine
until the final step... FC refused to show me the Login screen!!
Finally at 3 am I gave up.... I planned to get the most valuable
stuff onto a CD and set things right, back in the comforts of my
room and the company of Voodoo, but that was not to be....

At 10am, (I just woke up then), I find that the comp at home
refuses to turn ON!! I thought it was some petty problem like a
loose contact somewhere, which could be set right easily.. but
after an hour of struggle.. I realise that the problem is
serious.. {The SMPS had blown off} [looks like a Hindi
Movie,doesn't it??]

Then began the real fun!! I somehow managed to connect the old
hard disk to the new Mother Board...[my new cabinet is quite
small... I now realize that I placed the HDD in quite a precarious
position...].. but there was no OS on either HDD... [the "Windows"
on the old one.... din't open... they felt awkward in their new
environs... ;-) ] I would have returned back to coll without any
of my stuff.. but for Knoppix (live) ... it saved the day for me!!
Finally I managed to dump my stuff onto the new HDD... [All 's
well that ends well!! :-)] Now I've got both the Linux distro's
[Debian and FC-6] along with all the stuff I collected at home! [
Thanks to V00d00!! ] along with a little confidence that I am not
too bad at handling H/W!

When I look back at this whole episode... It feels as if nature
had conspired.... to keep this one resolution of mine ALIVE.... to
ignite in me the fire of "the spirit of true hacking"... [ I hope
that I play my part well.. (nature played its brilliantly...) and
pick up a zillionth part of the commitment ( and dedication to
hacking) of the Hackers from the Hacker Land!! ]

Here's a pic of one of the very few cool things I could get my
comp to do..... [ I accessed the Remote Desktop Server on my own
system.....]

I was at the B.M Birla Science Musuem yesterday... it was calm
with no one in there.. the only people i could see were the
sweepers and cleaners.. the place was dull and lifeless... I dint
like it.. but slowly.. as the afternoon progressed.. people
started coming in and by 5 in the evening.. there were quite a few
in. The museum seemed to have sprung to life suddenly... there was
a lot of action all around with people enjoying in ( and trying to
understand) the wonderful world of science....

A lot of kids had come along with their parents... to dive into
the world of science... they were enjoying it... the parents also
turned into kids and were having great fun... it was a great
sight... the parents tried their best to demistify the
happenings... those with a science background did it from thier
knowledge.. the others patiently went through the explanations...

The kids were thoroughly enjoying it... I don't know if they would
later on in life remember what they learnt now... but definitely a
love for science and physics will be ignited in their hearts, it
will fill their consciousness... the spirit of curiosity will have
multiplied manifold... even the elders..connected with the child
somewhere deep within themselves... they too enjoyed the wonders
of the world of science...[and ofcourse the company and thrill in
the eyes of their kids..] I too enjoyed the experience... the
experiments and the thrill of the others brought a smile to my
face too.... but it set me thinking...

If science can inspire so much awe.. what's happening at our
engineering colleges? When people have the chance to learn a whole
lot of science and put it to practical use... why isn't it that
they are excited about it? Why is it that people just endup
mugging a few formulae just before exams and get over with it?
Where's the problem? Where is that curiosity, all of us had as a
child, lost?

I can recollect, in the last sem while doing experiments in the MT
lab there wasn't even a tenth of the awe or joy... that i could
see and feel at the museum... why?? Is it that the child within
us.. [the future engineers] dead? { If that's true.. then the
country is in deep trouble..} But I don't think that's true... I
enjoyed my visit to the museum totally...and I am sure every other
'to be engineer' would have too.. then where's the trouble?

I don't know exactly... but I wonder if its because everything is
equated to marks and grades... all that matters to an engineering
student [and the world around him/her..] is his/her CG or
%age... Is this what the country needs? Were the 'temples of
Learning'- the IIT's and a whole lot of other technical
institutions set-up for this very pupose? Of what use are those
engineers to the country, who aren't in awe of science and
engineering, whose spirit of curiosity has been overpowered and
suppressed by the present education system?

Isn't it time we have a closer look at our education system... why
are we still sticking to the 'British sytem' introduced during a
colonial rule.. to break the back bone of our nation... to supress
our ability to think rationally.. to produce third rate clerks to
work for them at lower wages? Why is the emphasis on marks and
grades growing exponentially? Shouldn't we start working to cut
this growth at its root? Is this sytem good enough to produce
"real" engineers, doctors, lawyers, journos, CA's, architects,
designers, writers, artists etc etc..

Where have all the gurukuls of the ancient past and the
Santiniketans of the recent past gone? Isn't the country in
desparate need of more of these 'temples of learning'??

I am back Home!! After one more ordinary semester, (academically,
otherwise quite a dramatic one actually) finally i'm back home! On
my way back home......

It was 3:30 am. After about half an hour's struggle to put myself
to sleep, I gave up. I don't know if it was the chill of the
night, the stink of the urinals or the shared berth that I slept
on, I couldn't sleep. I decided to get up and have a stroll
around. After some random walks, I sat down at the TTE's seat and
waited and waited and waited....

My last journey home, at the end of second sem was also quite
similar. I spent a lot of time at the TTE's seat...unable to
sleep... waiting, waiting and waiting.. but it was quite
different.... I was in the elite company of Hari (Hari Charan
a.k.a Prongs... his nick in CS)

That journey is still very fresh in my memory... I spent most of
it with him; The morning was busy and lively with DumbC's n stuff
like that. In the afternoon while the others were enjoying a good
nap, we tried studying some C programming. [ he just loved
programming and was excited about doing a lotta cool stuff during
the summer] But the afternoon heat got the better of me and
eventually i fell asleep...{I think, I induced a bit of sleep to
him too ;-) }

That night is a most unforgettable one... after all our guys went
to sleep, both of us decided to spend some time listening to songs
and try to put ourselves to sleep. [ The songs of RDB aren't
lullabies by any measure! and the train was running too fast: we
couldn't hear clearly with just one earphone each, even if we were
on the top berth]

So, we ended up discussing matters of common interest... we
chatted on topics ranging from Movies to Religion and Culture to
Dan Brown [he told me the whole story of Deception point in his
trademark style!] to Games and Programming. I spoke my heart
out... {and so did he; as he always did} [haven't had any other
discussion which comes close to it] After a couple of hours, we
decided to get down and move around, to enjoy the cool breeze, to
look at the villages and the fields going past... We shared the
seat of the TTE for about an hour [that was the only window where
we could sit : all the others had ppl sleeping beside them]
... looking out of the window... enjoying the breeze.. [and each
other's company : I thoroughly enjoyed his.. hope it was the same
with him too] and waiting, waiting and waiting...

We had already spent three nights waiting for him, but still
didn't lose hope. We hoped he would some how return or would be
found safe somewhere under the sun. But that was not to be. He
never returned... and all that was ever found was his body :
lifeless... The rough seas had him their victim... "There's no
more Hari Charan, ra!". Those were the words of nine.

Yes he is no more.Yet he is always here, immortal within our
hearts... his memories we cherish with pride... proud to have
known him and known by him... with awe and reverence we think of
him... we just love him! But I'll always miss that call of his,
"Chogni!"

* DONE The Joy of a 'Project!' :blab:lafootgiri:ology:project:

:EXPORT_DATE: 2006-11-06T13:48:00+05:30

Just finished the 'Test-2'. Here's the first
post that can genuinely be called "mine"...

With my last minute 'C2S' plans [Co-operate to Survive... does it
ring any bells??] failing to work, the tests did their job,cleaned
me up [both literally and metaphorically]. Though I didn't learn
much while preparing for the tests, the syllabus gave me a brain
wave (surprised to find that my Brain is still ticking.... after
more than one year of Engg.) : Build my first Computer game!!
[Don't expect too much from it... I'm a novice at programming and
my game doesn't even have a GUI as of now!]

I had been doing a l'l bit of C programming off late but, I never
learnt 'file management' until the "Test-2" forced me to, and
Viola! I embarked on a self assigned, "Project - Hangman".

Here's a peek at the game... [after a lot of
testing and debugging (the use of technical terms is just a matter
of "phantee")]

"Phantee"- a typical hyderabadi term; has no literal english
translation; refers to "concealing ignorance in style" ??

The basics were quite simple and were done in
two hours... but then began the real test! The program needed a
lot of improvements to make it "Playable" but, the tests were less
than a week away.

I managed to find enough time even during the
tests (it doesn't really matter whether you spend a week, a day or
just an hour mugging - you are bound to be cleaned up!), and
finished most of the stuff within a week.

There were quite a few road blocks which I had to get
around. Amongst other things, obtaining a 'decent' database of
words was one. Initially, I wrote another program for building up
a dbase of your own. This wasn't good enough.... so, with some
ideas from Arunodai, I successfully integrated a dbase of 14000
words [picked it from another version of hangman] with my own
version. After one whole week of debugging and improving {with an
annoying disturbance called 'Test-2'}, now my game is quite
'playable' (i.e it can be played by people other than me).

So you might say, "what's the big-deal about writing a simple
program of about hundred lines, that can randomly display words
and check if you guess it right within seven turns?". This l'll
project of mine may seem like a Pro'jest' to many! [writing a
complex code, messing it up, debugging it for one whole week, etc
just for the sake of creating a simple game, that can be played if
you have a friend,a pen and a paper. Doing so much<span
class="text"> for a game, that already has 'n' version,
seems very foolish and a collosal waste
of time and effort. Doesn't it??] Obviously, that's not a great
achievement, its not something thats worth a mention in the
Guiness Book of World Records or something. But it taught me a lot
of stuff, stuff that you can't learn from books,stuff that you
can't learn by mugging [I wonder if you can learn anything under
the sun by "Mugging"], stuff that you can only learn by
experience.I learnt a lot more of Computer Programming through
this project, than I learnt through two, '3-point' courses!! {Of
course, I wouldn't have even dreamt of doing such a thing, if not
for these two courses, that introduced me to programming and
taught me the essentials}. Can't such projects make the other
courses a joy too?

This brings me to our recent TRW [Technical Report Writing]
project. You might wonder what kind of projects could be given in
this kind of a course. We were asked to write a report on 'Waste
Management' in our college, and to include some suggestions on the
ways to improve it. Though this was an interesting job, with scope
for some field activity and other such stuff, we [a group of six
members] successfully turned the 'project' into a Pro'jest'!!
[that's my personal view; the others in the group may
disagree].But still, we learnt a lot on Report writing. A lot more
than what we learnt by reading pages and pages of instructions, on
the techniques of writing good reports,by the so called experts.

Both the projects helped me understand stuff better and to put
them to use. Why can't all courses have little projects, along
with the routine stuff? Will it not improve my understanding of
the subject matter? Will I not learn a great deal of things more
than I do by mugging things up, just a week before the tests? Will
it not be an experience, a lesson, of its own??

I wonder if my "Engineering", will ever be a joy for me?

I am looking forward to more Projects... to make engineering a joy
for me!! [it doesn't matter even if they're self-assigned ;-) ]

Subject: Tribute to freedom.

Hello,

One late rainy night I had an idea. There is a hill on IL route 29
in Peoria IL, that people climb and write a small message across
this hill for everyone to view from a far. What would be better
than spreading my two most favorite words across this hill. So we
set out with a little over 200 garbage bags and nearly 400
nails. 12:30am and rainy so you can figure that a hill of that
size is going to be slippery (lol) nearly falling down hill with
every step we start building each letter. At around 2:30am we have
finished and now the sun will rise over a hill which spreads the
words Free Software to every person that passes by. This is by far
a vary small non-complex hack but I beleve it is a hack in it
self. This is a tribute to Free Software [and the GNU Project].

Happy Hacking

This week was a busy one, and I didn't really consume too much web content.

A colleague mentioned that he was reading the book -- [[https://www.amazon.com/Millennial-Project-Colonizing-Galaxy-Eight/dp/0316771651/][The Millennial Project: Colonizing
the Galaxy in Eight Easy Steps]]  and it seemed to have some interesting ideas
that I've never come across before.

The [[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=berklee+indian+ensemble][Berklee Indian Ensemble]] performed at the [[http://www.bgu.co.in/][Bengaluru Ganesh Utsava]] and I went
along with [[https://twitter.com/Sunil_santiago][Sunil]] to their performance, which we thoroughly loved.

I liked [[http://smo.nu/how-to-have-healthy-relationships-as-a-developer/][this article]] advising developers on having healthy relationships.  Most
of it is common sense stuff -- "Whether it be a side project or main project,
understand that sacrificing relationships isn't worth it."

I really enjoyed [[http://theladiesfinger.com/autorickshaw-rides/][this article]] by Priyanka on how she started talking to Auto
Drivers.  She shares a bunch of stories of drivers she talked to, that makes me
wonder how many more such stories just go unheard, because I don't talk.

@scopatz wrote up a [[https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com/issues/413#issuecomment-243598510][nice argument]] explaining why @github should add back BSD to
the list of licenses shown on the site.  It taught me a thing or two about BSD
and MIT.

I enjoyed spending the weekend at [[https://twitter.com/_mavin][@_mavin]]'s place, discussing continuous
improvement in life, among other things.  Also, had a lot of fun playing
[[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.goog.ellen.psych&hl=en][Psyche]].  The game is so addictive, but the app is not all that great.  Someone
should make a more robust app for this, or something that piggybacks on an
existing network service like Telegram or Facebook chat or Google hangouts.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erywPdFfORE][Falling In Love At A Coffee Shop by Landon Pigg]] is a lovely song, that I

Lots of Olympics stuff this week!

I really liked this ad - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8to12qpeXg][Rukna Nahi Hai]] - wishing all the Olympians a
wonderfully spirited competition, at Rio.  Go!

Brazilian marathoner Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima, the man who lit the Olympic
flame, inspires me with [[http://qz.com/752356/the-inspiring-reason-olympic-marathoner-vanderlei-cordeiro-de-lima-lit-the-olympic-cauldron/][his spirit]].

am on the relay team. But in the next Olympics, I want to qualify for the
individual event. That's my aim.", he says.

[[https://twitter.com/vandith][@vandith]] recommended the [[http://www.nike.com/in/en_gb/c/nike-plus/training-app][Nike+ Training App]] to me and I really like it.  They
have some amazing workouts and pretty neat personalized workout plans.

Coke Studio Pakistan is trying a [[http://thereel.scroll.in/812923/coke-studio-for-the-deaf-will-change-the-way-you-think-about-music][delightful experiment]] with their show this
time -- they are trying to use lights and vibrations to let the
hearing-impaired experience the music on their show better!

Sainath's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQjLj-suogQ][keynote]] at Film Writers Association conference was yet another of his
thought-provoking speeches.  He sends you down a spiral of thought, when he
says, "How agonised we are when people die, and how untroubled we are by how
they live".  I also enjoyed watching his (long) [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYVLmHdBjPI][casual chat]] from an year ago,
talking about his life and influences on him.

David Sassoon the founder of InsideClimate News [[https://medium.com/insideclimate-news/seven-things-you-need-to-know-about-non-profit-journalism-f1409b95fdad#.4fai5oqca][writes]] about Non-Profit
journalism, the need for it, and how to have more of it.  He writes about it in
the American context, but India has its own share of troubles.  I consume quite
a bit of news from independent sources, but don't really contribute to keep
them going.  I should turn this around.

A bunch of residents of Urur Olcott Kuppam in Chennai [[http://scroll.in/article/813133/media-got-it-wrong-in-its-coverage-of-tm-krishnas-magsaysay-award-say-fishing-village-residents][responded]] to media's
broken coverage of TM Krishna's Magsaysay award.  I really liked how assertive
they were about their role in the music festival, its role in their lives, and
in clarifying how they see their fishing village as opposed to how the media
portrayed it.  They don't mince any words.

happening. You may not see it a direct connection between the events happening
in the world today and the climate in general, but that relationship does
exist. In Syria, everything started with a great drought. The Middle East, this
entire Mediterranean region, is going through a historic drought. And if you
think about how this tumult in the Arab world began, it was with protests over
food in Tunisia. So what we're facing really, if you like, is a catastrophic

Pierre buttin's [[http://www.pierrebuttin.com/work/dayonadevice/][screenshot art]] is amusing and gives a sense of how distracted

We were walking through the fields and bushes in Hampi and stopped at the gate

I really enjoyed reading the [[http://muse-amuse.in/~punchagan/317574828-Perumal-Judgment.pdf][full judgement]] given by the Madras High Court in
the Perumal Murugan case.  The court said something [[http://scroll.in/article/811211/the-right-to-write-key-bits-from-the-judgment-that-brings-author-perumal-murugan-back-from-the-dead][on the lines of]]: not all
art may be for everyone, and if you don't like a book, throw it away.  The
judgement also made it clear that it is the responsibility of the state to
ensure that things don't go haywire using appropriate measures, and banning
things left, right and center is not the way to deal with it.

  So many books, so little time. With this in mind, the Amazon Books
  editors set out to compile a list of 100 Books to Read in a
  Lifetime. We had a few goals when we started out: We wanted the list
  to cover all stages of a life (which is why you'll find children's
  books in here), and we didn't want the list to feel like
  homework. Of course, no such list can be comprehensive – our lives,
  we hope, are long and varied – but we talked and argued and sifted
  and argued some more and came up with a list, our list, of
  favorites.

  Do whatever you want.

  Don't take VC because Twitter did. Don't piss off investors because
  37signals likes to. Do whatever you want, whatever works best for
  you, what makes you the most comfortable and seems like the best
  idea. Do what you love.

  Any software project is a collaborative project. It has at least two
  developers, the original developer and the original developer a few
  weeks or months later when the train of thought has long left the
  station. This later self needs to reestablish the context of a
  particular piece of code each time a new bug occurs or a new feature
  needs to be implemented.

  Re-establishing the context of a piece of code is wasteful. We can't
  avoid it completely, so our efforts should go to reducing it to as
  small as possible. Commit messages can do exactly that and as a
  result, a commit message shows whether a developer is a good
  collaborator.

  you notice something missing. And often these gaps won't seem to be
  ideas for companies, just things that would be interesting to

  to build things just because they're interesting.

  Live in the future and build what seems interesting. Strange as it

  Machine Learning (or ML) offers the promise of having a computer
  pour through your data and automatically extract or create the
  information that you’re interested in. At least in theory. On closer
  inspection machine learning is a loosely defined collection of
  poorly explained statistical and algorithmic tricks that are magical
  when they work and fail fantastically when they don’t. Acquiring the
  needed skills for working with data safely is not easy. So we’ve
  assembled a solid set of suggestions and resources on getting
  started.

  short, badly written, or entirely missing documentation. Some

  This is not acceptable. There must be some middle ground between
  reams of technical specifications and no specifications at all. And
  in fact there is. That middle ground is the humble Readme.

  windows, mostly devoid of ornaments.

  The Portuguese arrived in Goa in 1510 and brought with them a host

  places. Goans who travelled abroad also returned with ideas and
  influences from other countries that they incorporated into their

  Here's my advice for Lucy:

  1) Stay wildly ambitious. The current world is bubbling with
     opportunity for an ambitious person to find flowery, fulfilling
     success. The specific direction may be unclear, but it'll work
     itself out -- just dive in somewhere.

  2) Stop thinking that you're special. The fact is, right now, you're
     not special. You're another completely inexperienced young person
     who doesn't have all that much to offer yet. You can become
     special by working really hard for a long time.

  3) Ignore everyone else. Other people's grass seeming greener is no
     new concept, but in today's image crafting world, other people's
     grass looks like a glorious meadow. The truth is that everyone
     else is just as indecisive, self-doubting, and frustrated as you
     are, and if you just do your thing, you'll never have any reason
     to envy others.

  actually be one of the most profound sources of abundance.

  :art:

  Art, and what we do and do not consider to be art, has changed a lot
  over the last century. It has become an increasingly difficult thing
  to define for the average person, and sometimes even art historians
  and experts can’t seem to keep up.

  This was illustrated in a 2005 survey done by ABC News in which
  modern masters’ works were mixed into a series with paintings done
  by children and toddlers. Regular people and art critics alike were
  asked to choose from the series – which of these works belong in a
  museum and which ones don’t? Now, Buzzfeed has released a similar
  survey as well, which we’ve expanded on a bit.

  The results of that survey indicate that either we have a long way
  to go before we can define what is and isn’t modern art, or that
  there’s no need to define it so strictly in the first
  place. Whatever the case may be, let’s see if you’re any better at
  telling modern art from children’s drawings than the experts are!

    The book deals with the supervised-learning problem for both regression and classification, and includes detailed algorithms. A wide variety of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and their properties discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and a classical perspective. Many connections to other well-known techniques from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance vector machines and others. Theoretical issues including learning curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation methods for learning with large datasets are discussed. The book contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets are available on the Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background and a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.

    In writing. Don't use adjectives which merely tell us how you want
    us to feel about the thing you are describing. I mean, instead of
    telling us a thing was "terrible," describe it so that we'll be
    terrified. Don't say it was "delightful"; make us say "delightful"
    when we've read the description. You see, all those words
    (horrifying, wonderful, hideous, exquisite) are only like saying
    to your readers, "Please will you do my job for me."

When it comes to hacking on opensource software, none of age, gender, race, country of origin, or how you look matters. All that matters is a pleasant attitude to your fellow developers, a willingness to keep at it and learn as you go, the drive to not give up when things don't go your way, and the ability to tell the difference between an idea and the one who has it.

    Braben has developed a tiny USB stick PC that has a HDMI port in one end and a USB port on the other. You plug it into a HDMI socket and then connect a keyboard via the USB port giving you a fully functioning machine running a version of Linux. The cost? $25.

Give your team 1 point for each "yes" answer. The bummer about The Joel Test is that you really shouldn't use it to make sure that your nuclear power plant software is safe.

  tags: life, programming, learning, inspiration

    The truth is, in the eleven plus years of my working life I’ve never worked at a software house, have never attended a computer class, and have no certifications. I wrote code through the ’90s, code and little else, telling everyone I was going to be a “software developer” when I grew up, and ultimately falling out of the academic system. But when it came to going to work, did I do the expected thing and join a software house? No, sir, I went into print publishing. What one does first sets the template, and this one sure did. I’ve put my foot into all manner of disciplines other than computer science, playing the saviour who produces the code, but bearing no certifications. I could afford it because I had put in my 10,000 hours already. After that much exposure, learning becomes automatic and incremental. I haven’t looked at a technology guide book in over a decade because I don’t need to. The book on my bedside today is on law. The one below it on film studies.

    more in other languages as I was in Lisp.  What's more, once I got
    knocked off my high horse (they had to knock me more than once -- if
    anyone from Google is reading this, I'm sorry) and actually bothered
    to really study some of these other languges I found *myself*
    suddenly becoming more productive in other languages than I was in
    Lisp.  For example, my language of choice for doing Web development
    now is Python.

    Looking back at that time, the restrictions of the environment are
    the biggest single factor in bringing out the best in the people
    that worked with computers back then. Think of your programming
    career as one endless code-golf competition trying to find a way to
    get both your data and your code in memory at the same time

    ... when I finally did land my coder job that I was amazed that
    people paid me for something that I would have gladly done for free

    Creativity knows no limits in a restricted environment. But

- I spent the whole of yesterday just working on the LED-bot.
- Spent some time cleaning up meta-stuff about the project, making it a real
  package, adding a setup.py, added LICENSE & AUTHOR files, etc.
- I found it really frustrating that there's no good/standard way to remove
  duplication of information between pip's =requirements.txt= and
  =install_requires=
- We got the bot running on the Beagle Bone, but it turned out to be too slow.
  After some playing around with trying to get rid of Python for-loops, I was
  able to use PIL's =image.tobytes= and some image cropping to get the data to
  be sent to the LEDs, and it sped up the display quite a bit.

- My talk at Hack and Tell went OK.  I was distracted by [[https://github.com/damianavila/live_reveal][live_reveal]] not
  displaying properly on the smaller resolution, and not being able to mirror
  screens!
- There were a bunch of interesting talks presented by the

- I worked with Dana and Marcus fixing a bunch of issues with the [[https://github.com/marqsm/LED-bot][HS LED
  Screen]]. I might work on it for a little bit today, doing a little more
  clean-up of the architecture.

- The Monday talk was Mary live coding a space invaders game.  It was a fun
  talk, that was very well planned.

- During the walk to the talk, Bert, Maia and I were talking about the idea of
  a School where projects were the atom of the curriculum, instead of courses.

*** Friday

  - I started playing around with React.js to see how I could build the GitHub
    organization dashboard, that I plan to.

*** Saturday

  - Got a horrendous idea of implementing a disqus-like commenting system using
    GitHub's issue comments, and ran with it.  It seems technically feasible
    based on some initial implementation.  I need to clean-up/rewrite the
    prototype code on Monday.

- I learnt about =send= and =throw= methods on generators!  I hadn't heard of

- I spent a little time late in the day getting class diffs working, and
  refactoring the api-diff tool to remove duplication of code between classes

- I spent the morning cleaning up the "repr" functions of the diff classes, so
  that the diff of functions between two modules can be printed out in a
  somewhat meaningful way.

- I spent most of the afternoon, preparing to make a small presentation on how
  =sys.path= works in Python.  I thought I didn't do as good a job of it, as I
  would've liked, but Tom thought it was not too bad...

- Looks like another of those days, where I didn't get much done...  I spent

- I feel like I didn't get much done yesterday.
- I mostly worked on the API differ, but didn't get much done.  I have a few
  tests, and some code for diffing two functions, but I'm not very happy with
  it.
- I helped Giorgio and Carlos with using my client only =hs_oauth=
  script/library, for their Zulip bot.
- The white boarding group worked on some binary related problems, and it was
  fun.
- I looked at how the HS OAuth backend works on blaggregator and thought about
  how to go about fixing the issue of broken images on the site.  The problem
  happens because the image URLs are returned from the HS API calls, that are
  made whenever a user logs in(?), and the URLs are cached.  Since, HS uses
  cloudfront for its assets, the URLs expire after a period of time, and the
  cached urls in blag's database need to be updated.  There could be two ways
  of doing it -
  1. Check if the URL 404s, every time a URL is requested, on the server side.
  2. Do it on the client side, with some javascript magic.

  Intuitively, I feel like 2. would be better, but Madhu suggested
  that 1. wouldn't be that bad either.  We could try both out, and see which
  works better I suppose.

  I'd be interested to try this out, sometime.

- An issue I was seeing with =pip= and a package installed in
  =system-site-packages= turned out to be non-reproducible.  It was probably
  PEBKAC.
- I was wondering around in the morning trying to find something to work on.
- I decided to work on Pankaj's idea to write a tool that gives you API
  differences between two versions of a library.  It would be useful to have
  the list of public API changes in a library you use, to estimate the cost of
  updating to the newer version, without having to manually go through all the
  changes.

  refactored code.

- I spent about an hour in the morning testing out the staging blaggregator
  instance, and things seemed to work as expected.  Side note, I got added as a
  collaborator on the blaggregator repo!
- We worked through the first chapter on getting video working, but we mostly
  ended up just copying code rather than actually understanding/carefully
  studying it.  I'm not sure how I feel about it, but we got to display fancy
  stuff.
- I wasn't feeling like working on any of my 'old'/'ongoing' projects, and
  since Mondays don't feel very productive, I worked on writing a couple of
  simple scripts to create twitter lists of HSers, batch wise.

  For the HS API, I just reused some old code I had lying around from my
  experiments with the OAuth2 API, though I had to tweak it a little bit to be
  able to actually login, using requests. Something about CSRF tokens seems to
  have changed.

  In the process, I found that twitter's API isn't very pleasant to use.  Or
  may be it's the fact that I was using python twitter client without getting
  my own client id/key, but the whole experience of dealing with the twitter
  API wasn't a pleasant one at all!
- Amber, Daria and I also spent about an hour white-boarding some problems from
  the Cracking the Code Interview book.
- I ended up fixing some minor issues with blaggregator and am hoping that the
  long pending PR will be merged today.

- I spent the morning doing some white-boarding interview practice with a Jorge
  and Brian.
- I spent the rest of the day, playing with PyPy and working through [[http://morepypy.blogspot.in/2011/04/tutorial-writing-interpreter-with-pypy.html][a tutorial]]
  that teaches us to write a BF interpreter.
- I spent the Saturday revamping my Emacs config.  The main issue with my
  config was having a "package" list, of all the packages that the
  configuration uses, in case we are trying to duplicate it elsewhere.  I
  noticed that this gets out of sync, because I install packages by hand and
  never update this list.  I wrote up [[https://github.com/punchagan/dot-emacs/blob/master/user-lisp/setup-defuns.el][some code]], that keeps this list in sync
  with all the packages I have installed.  I configured el-get to play well
  with my config, and am pretty happy with my setup, though I still have to add
  some matching/searching features with helm/ido/whatever else.

*** C stuff
  - In the morning I cleaned up the code to open torrent files, and parse them.
  - I worked on a function to do encode text properly, and Sophia helped me

*** Friday
  - On Friday, I didn't do the exercises that everyone else doing job prep were
    doing.  I wanted to continue writing C code, and continued to work on the
    =bencode= parser in C.  I barely was able to finish adding support for lists.
  - I got comfortable using Valgrind, in the process of debugging a stupidity of
    not using =realloc= correctly.
  - What I was able to write with Python in an hour or so, I have been writing
    for about a day, in C, and haven't yet finished it!  It definitely doesn't
    help that my C is very rusty...

*** Saturday & Sunday
  - I didn't work much, and went around New York with Madhu.  We went to quite
    a few places around here, the highlight being, the view of Manhattan's
    skyline from the Staten Island Ferry.
  - NYC's library also had an interesting exhibhition on the history of
    America, just before and during WW-I.
  - On Sunday, I tried out Mary TTS on the raspberry pi, and it is simply
    unusable.
  - I then, started writing a simple wrapper around Google's tts that is used
    by Google translate.
  - The TTS part is more or less working right now, the next step would be to
    deploy it on the RaspberryPi and start using it as a radio, to see what my
    needs are like. Hooking it up to [[https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client][Jasper client]] seems like a good idea,
    right now... though I'm not sure if it would work very well, with the pi's
    audio output drowning out the voice commands.

*** Hacking: learning by breaking stuff
- Post lunch, I started pairing with Stephanie on the exercises in the [[http://www.nostarch.com/hacking2.htm][Hacking]]
  book, and that turned out to be super fun!
- We got through the chapter on exploitation, which focussed on stack
  overflows, heap overflows, overflows in function pointers, and string
  formatting exploits.  It acted as more than a gentle refresher for C, and was
  super fun!
- Running the examples on a 64bit system, added an additional amount of
  thinking required, and was good, IMO.
- I hadn't worked along with Stephanie on the material in the first two
  chapters.  So, I went back home and tried to catch up, but couldn't get all
  of it done.

- I spent part of the morning wrapping up the install script for the raspberry
  project, and cleaning up the repository.  [[https://github.com/kbeyer/RPi-LED-SpectrumAnalyzer][It looks reasonable now]], and I

- I also tried to look for "easy" python issues that would involve me writing
  some C code, but didn't really find anything other than documentation... I
  guess, I should pick a module and look for bugs in it, instead.
- Also, while chatting with a friend, I had to explain that I don't mention the

- I spent the afternoon, adding tests for a simple issue, to see how patches are sent.
- Later, I paired with Sophia for an hour to refactor the vcs code. It's
  beginning to look much better than what it used to, and I like that.
- Jessica's talk on buffer overflows was enlightening and entertaining. It was
  very similar to a talk that Max gave on one of the thursdays, but it was
  exciting nevertheless.
- After the talk, I am inspired to try and work through the Hacking: Art of
  exploitation, at some point. I'm beginning to feel like time at HackerSchool
  running out!

- We worked on writing our own (toy) version control system on Friday, as a
  part of job prep.  I paired with Sophia, and we got upto the point where we
  had diffs working, when we decided to refactor the code with some tests and
  stuff.
- The party was brilliant with a lot of activity.  All the project
  installations looked so cool, and it was so much fun!
- I spent some time during the weekend watching the "Anatomy of Matplotlib"
  lectures.
- I started some work with poking around Matplotlib's template backend, and
  trying to start writing and ascii backend.
- Also, I was trying to help UC setup [[https://github.com/andrewrk/groovebasin][GrooveBasin]] on his raspberry pi, and
  helped him configure [[https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client][jasper]] on it.

*** Glowing LEDs and me
- It turned out that the SPI driver exposed a faster way to write bits, writing
  to all the LEDs at once, instead of one at a time, and this was sufficient to
  get things working!

- Kyle and I started to have enough, of the glowing LEDs and decided to wrap up
  the project, but, Nick had different ideas for us! We had talked about having
  the music stream via airplay, but Nick got his DJing tools, and it would be
  too bad to not use it for the party, but doing that meant Airplay's delay
  wouldn't help the DJ. So, we connected a line-in, and thought we'd be done if
  we just read the input and used that data. But, it turns out that's not so
  simple because sending data over the wire, added noise to it, and in a whole
  range of frequencies! I tried removing all the fourier coefficients which
  were lower than a threshold, but I felt like it didn't work very well, until
  Nick reduced the gain of this output on the amp to the very minimum. Finally,
  Kyle and I decided that this was good enough for the party!

- I also hacked up a quick script to read a font file, and use the grey values
  to get ascii characters to show up on the LED strip.

*** Miscellaneous

- While trying to find the RPi on the network, I learnt that =sudo nmap -sP
  10.0.1.*= gives us the hostname as well, instead of just IPs.  =sudo= being
  the key, here.

- Kyle and I went and grabbed dinner in a restaurant in west village. It was
  good to sit down and talk about various things, and eat. The glowing LEDs
  were totally out of my mind for that period, and the break was good!

- There were a bunch of HSers doing mock-interviews and it was fun to watch, so
  I stayed on until quite late, when all of us headed out together.

*** Today

  - I'm excited about trying to build a small version control system from
    scratch today!

  - Though I have had quite a bit of glowing LEDs in my face for the past week,
    I may suck up to it, and figure out how to do scrolling text on the
    display.

  - Also, excited to see how all the cool projects will come together in the
    party tonight!

*** Shairplay and WS2801

- Kyle mounted the LEDs onto a cardboard, and packaged it to look cool.

- We thought we were done with the project, until we found out we weren't!  The
  LEDs all lighted up correctly, when we played the audio from a file on disk,
  but streaming messed something up!  Only the first few columns lighted up,
  when we were listening on the stream.

- We spent the whole evening trying to debug the issue, and eliminated quite a
  few hypothesis, but weren't able to fix it, yet.

*** Miscellaneous

- rntz live coded a parser for us yesterday, and I learnt a few things about
  parsers.  I'm glad I went to the discussion/talk.

- I started working through the videos of Anatomy of Matplotlib, and hope to
  get new insights into how it works.

*** Today

- Today will be spent mostly trying to get streaming audio working.

- I feel like debugging this, will take my understanding of the
  hardware-software interface to a new level.

*** Mel's talks
- Mel's talk in the morning was brilliant!  I wonder why it's not a part of
  recommended reading for Hacker Schoolers, or referred to, in the manual.
- Logically, it makes sense that Mel came now, so that she didn't have to come
  twice to talk to the firsts and seconds, but it would have been great to have
  had this talk in the first week of Hacker School!
- Mel gave us a lot of new information and insights into education and learning
  styles. I also like the fact that she gave us all a good vocabulary to think
  about and discuss stuff related to learning. I will try to think, and apply
  as much of this as I can, for the rest of my time here.
- She talked about [[http://blog.melchua.com/2014/02/10/test-driven-learning-setting-learning-goals-for-yourself-software-engineering-edition/][test driven learning]] which seemed very interesting. Instead
  of just saying, "wow that would be an interesting thing to do", stop for a
  moment, think about what you are trying to learn, and how you will assess if
  you have learnt what you wanted to, and then dive into the project.
- The [[http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html][learning styles]] workshop was pretty good too, though I feel like I don't
  know myself well enough, and I unable to properly "bucket" myself.  Later, I
  took a [[http://www.engr.ncsu.edu/learningstyles/ilsweb.html][quiz]], and ended up fairly close to the middle, in all the dimensions.
- Mel introduced us to the idea of [[http://www.scribd.com/doc/201816780/A-Cognitive-Apprenticeship-Primer][cognitive apprenticeship]], and encouraged us
  to try out the different modes when pairing. I really liked the idea of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development][Zone
  of proximal development]] and I will try to take the advice of spending most of
  the rest of my time here in this zone.
- Do I (really) care?  Motivation and mindset, ...
- Be courageous!

*** Airplay and Raspberry Pi
- I was trying to wrap libshairport and use it on the RPi to be able to listen
  to songs being streamed on Airplay, and use that data to drive the LEDs.
- Shairport, a tool written in C seemed to work.  My attempts to wrap
  =libshairport=, which is a fork of =shairport= converting it into a library,
  failed miserably.
- The trouble was essentially getting Airplay to discover my service.  I tried
  a bunch of things with =pybonjour= and =avahi=, but wasn't able to get it
  right.
- Finally, I tried just announcing the service with =shairport=, and actually
  running a python script that wraps =libshairport= to listen to the data.
  But, this didn't work and iTunes complained that this Airplay device is not
  compatible. Before going much further with this, I found =shairplay= which is
  a tool similar to =shairport=, but came with a library, and also Python
  bindings!  I happily used this to get stuff working!
- I'm interested to see today, what exactly I was missing yesterday!

*** Emacs club
  - I demoed org-mode to a bunch of people for about half an hour, and it was
    good to see people being blown away by what it can do, exactly the way I
    was, when I first came across it.

*** Today
  - Work on RPi to clean up a few things for the party.
  - Compare =libshairplay= and =libshairport= to see what I was doing wrong,
    yesterday.
  - May be write up the whole thing, and make the code available.
  - Learn a little bit about Parsers from rntz.

*** Yesterday

- It was exciting to have so many new Hacker Schoolers in the space.  But, the
  excitement was kinda distracting too.

- I spent most of the day looking at shairport, and libshairport and trying to
  wrap it, so I can use it to get data for the spectrum analyzer via the
  Air-play protocol.  I was able to call it using =ctypes=, but it doesn't seem
  discoverable.

- I also briefly looked at Julia and [[http://dwm.suckless.org][dwm]], to try and port dwm to Julia.  It
  doesn't seem like too much work, but is going to take me a while given how
  comfortable I'm with both Julia and C.

- Yaron Minsky's talk on distributed systems was a great introduction to
  Distributed systems.

- After the talk, I spent a little time updating my notes from an old org-mode
  workshop to present it at the emacs user group meet up today.

*** Today

- I hope to get the spectrum analyzer to use =libshairport= and be able to play
  music sent through Air play.

- Spend some time talking to the emacs user group about org-mode.

- If I have any time, after getting this to work, I may play around with the
  dwm port.

*** Saturday & Sunday

- During the weekend, I had this idea of building a personalized "radio" for
  myself using a Raspberry pi.  The idea is to have a service where all my
  bookmarks, and feeds are accumulated to, instead of eating up valuable
  browser tab real estate.  And then, I could use a Raspberry pi to randomly
  play content off of it, based on a theme.

- I worked on getting things together for it, during the weekend.  The project
  is more like a "thing that needs to be done", rather than something that puts
  me out of my comfort zone, atleast as far as I can see. So, I'm just going to
  work on it as a background thing, between other projects, etc.

- Festival seemed OK initially, while I was trying things out, but when I
  actually used it to read me a blog post, it was really terrible!  I tried
  demos of a few commercial tools, and they seem much better than what festival
  had to offer.  I wonder what it would take to get Festival, up there.  I
  tried using Google's translate service's tts (unofficial API) and it seemed
  so good!  But, it limits each request to 100 bytes, and the audio will have
  to be downloaded via the Network.

- Madhu pointed me to MaryTTS, which seemed to be an active project and it
  seemed to be much better than Festival, though not as good as Google's tts.
  I'm going to try getting it to run on a Pi, next.

*** Monday

  - I don't really know what I'm doing to work on, today.  I have been playing
    around with the Pi, for the past week-ish, and it has been fun!  Kyle and I
    will probably work more on tweaking it, to get it to work the way we want
    it, for the party!

  - I also did a little bit of Julia with Sean, and it was fun.  I may try
    playing around with it, a little bit, but not sure what to work on.  May be
    continue working through the think-complexity book using Julia?

  - Or jump into something I totally don't know about, inspired by listening to
    Julia Evans' podcast for Ruby Rogues.  I just got this idea of trying to
    write a window manager to understand how X works, and what wayland is...  I
    could try porting dwm or i3wm to Julia.

  - There's a whole new bunch of excited Hacker Schoolers in the space, and its
    very exciting!

- Kyle and I did a demo of our spectrum analyzer/visualizer during the
  presenations.  It was fun to work on, though we mostly just followed a
  tutorial on the web, and made use of a bunch of libraries.
- I spent the night in HackerSchool.
- I was cleaning up the code in the tutorial we were trying to follow.
- Also, cleaned up the install.sh used by [[https://bitbucket.org/togiles/lightshowpi/src][lightshowpi]] project to not do all the
  ugly sudo setups, and use a Python virtualenv and install into that.
- Refactored the ugly looking music part of the tutorial into a smaller script
  with only the functionality that we were going to use.
- We hit an interesting bug that would light up all the LEDs on the strip, once
  in a while.  I didn't notice it during the night, because I had a "decay"
  factor (the max factor by which the height of the columns should get reduced
  between successive updates) was 0.9, but when the decay factor was reduced to
  a lower value, it would happen quite often.  Also, we didn't see this
  happening before.  So, we thought the bug was in the code I had written, when
  I should have been sleeping. After reading and debugging my code for a bit,
  with Kyle and Sean, I thought it was something hardware related that we were
  doing wrong.  But, it turns out that a library we were using lit-up the whole
  strip, when start and end values were both zero, instead of not lighting up
  anything!
- Also, we hit another off-by one error, just before the demo. I didn't do the
  math for splitting the strip into columns too carefully, and we hadn't
  noticed the off-by one error until we taped up the strip into different
  columns on a pillar for demo.
- There were some cool presentations by others.  I'll update the list on
  Monday, since I currently don't remember them all!  Looking at the list of
  names on the registration sheet would help!
- The cleaned up code is [[https://gist.github.com/punchagan/90a238fedabcd88ba512][here]]

- Started pairing with Kyle on his idea of building a spectrum analyzer on the
  RaspberryPi using a LED Strip.  Both of us were fairly new to the RPi, and we
  spent the morning, setting it up, and stepping through steps in [[https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-spectrum-analyzer-display-on-rgb-led-strip][this tutorial]].
- The tutorial, I felt, wasn't very well written, and definitely not suitable
  for absolute beginners to start with.
- The code didn't seem to work for us, too.  The project put together a bunch
  of libraries, in a way that someone who knew their way could follow along.
- Dana helped us and explained many things, about differences between SPI/GPIO,
  and the precautions to take, helped us hook up stuff, etc.  It was great to
  have her stepping in an helping every now and then!
- While Kyle was pairing on an Alum, I worked through the Graph Theory chapter
  in the Think Complexity book, and read about the abrupt changes of
  characteristics in random graphs, that were very similar and related to the
  phenomenon in percolation theory that Nava explained.
- Later in the day, I played around with the python-googlevoice API, that
  someone laboriously wrote after lot of careful html/xml parsing.
- I spent the night, refactoring the code to display random data on the
  LEDStrip as a display of columns.  And then also ended up cleaning up the
  setup scripts, and the way things need to be installed.

- Micheal demo-ed paredit mode in the emacs-club meetup, and I learnt a bunch
  of things I didn't know about it.
- I added simpler tests (just one test, really) for =cinspect= using a dummy
  module, and Tom started reviewing the code.  I wrapped up the code (for now),
  until there is further interest in the project (in the form of issues/feature
  requests).  I haven't yet announced it anywhere, but I probably should.
- I helped Teja (a friend of mine, not in HS) with a simple function to use
  bisection to solve an equation.  He's just starting off with Python, and am
  looking forward to see where he goes with it!
- I learned a few things about the V8 code base, thanks to sitting next to
  Marcus, who is poking around with it.
- I started looking for other things to do, and went through a little bit of
  the Audio programming book, but didn't do it for too long, until I stumbled
  on [[http://greenteapress.com/complexity/][Think Complexity]] and started reading it.  I read the introduction, and got
  through a few of the exercises on Graphs.
- I also played around Flask-Sockets to help figure out answers to some
  questions on Zulip, and was able to get a [[https://gist.github.com/punchagan/53600958c1799c2dcf26][Hello World]] working.
- In the process, I discovered the awesomeness of the gist-mode in emacs.  I
  had always wanted gist plugins to let me list and update my previous gists,
  but most of the plugins didn't seem to have it, or the feature wasn't very
  discoverable.  I had tried writing something like that for Canopy, one or two
  years ago.  Discovering that gist mode has this feature, was awesome!

*** Work on cinspect
- I wrote up a README since David (an alum at Hacker School) showed interest in
  the project.  But, he probably isn't that interested anymore since the code
  base is Python2.x only.
- I got rid of assumptions that method names would start with the module name
  or the type name, and actually look up references to the names in the
  definitions of types or objects.
- I also improved the test-suite to actually download sources of CPython and
  index them.  They take very very long!!
- I tried to get it working with Numpy, but getting all the headers to include
  wasn't as easy as I assumed it would be!

- I didn't spend much time at Hacker School on Friday.  I reached a bit late
  for the start of "Recursion day", and did a few problems.  The problems were
  simple, but interesting.  After lunch, I headed home to start to Philly.
- Later in the day, I did some refactoring of the code to have the index reader
  and writer split out.
- I also added a setup.py to be able to install the package using the standard
  tools instead of PYTHONPATH hacks and stuff.
- During the refactoring, I again hit [[./posts/an-import-gotcha-in-python.html][this bug]].  I found out from Pankaj that
  he has =from __future__ import print_function, absolute_imports= at the start
  of his files these days.  I think I'm going to do it, too.

*** Saturday & Sunday

- I didn't do much during the weekend. I ended up adding a TXT record for SPF
  for this domain, to work around Gmail marking bulk mails for the
  [[http://github.com/punchagan/childrens-park][childrens-park]] newsletter as spam. I was able to send one newsletter, but not
  sure if only the SPF is enough or I'll have to setup DKIM, and other stuff.
  (I don't understand most of these acronyms!)

- Someone mentioned [[http://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv]] on Zulip, and I
  really liked the idea.  I have started using it for a couple of projects and
  also got rid of a couple of my bashrc aliases, and created a new [[https://github.com/punchagan/home-bin/blob/master/project][project]]

- Unicode issues: it turned out that (atleast) one of the files had a character
  that wasn't UTF-8 encoded. I got around it by trying 'utf-8', if not falling
  back to 'iso-8859-1'.  Now that I think about it, I should fallback to

- I did a little clean up on the way the indexes were stored, to be able to
  have a =getfile=, to mimic =inspect='s API.
- I also "improved" the IPython startup script to monkey-patch the source code
  formatter/colorizer to not break with C modules.

- As preparation for a one-on-one this week with one of the facilitators, I was
  wondering if I was really getting better as a programmer, by doing what I am
  doing.
- I have heard at numerous places that reading and reflection are keys to
  getting better. I feel like I haven't been giving these things much attention
  in the past couple of weeks. I don't catch up on reading all the awesome
  reading material shared on Zulip and I switched from writing this blog post
  first thing in the morning, to any-time-after-lunch. I don't think this
  worked out very well. Writing the post worked as a way to reflect on what I
  had done yesterday, and what I should be doing today. So, I am back to
  writing the blog post, first thing in the morning!
- Yesterday, I worked on indexing the Python sources in a way that the
  inspection code can look up, later.  During this process, I found that my
  code to use libclang's AST wasn't generic enough, and I had to clean it up to
  be able to extract useful information from any file in the =cpython= sources.
- We also got to attend a super-awesome talk by [[http://words.steveklabnik.com/][Steve Labnik]]! He talked about
  his progression from being an application developer, to writing libraries, to
  working on languages (as a professional developer). He made a lot of
  interesting and inspiring points during his talk.  Some of those that stuck
  with me are:
  - None of these is particularly harder than any of the other. Depending on
    each person's personality, or the way their brain works, they are good at
    doing one or the other.
  - Getting good at programming is a matter of showing up, more than about the
    "genes".  He repeated quite a few times that he disliked the idea of "baby
    hacker", and left out the story of his childhood and college programming
    days! I'm totally stealing his idea of meeting every saturday at 1pm, with
    a bunch of friends and working until it was 10pm or so, when they could get
    cheap beer and food!  And he did this all through his college!  It is
    interesting that this idea is so similar to Hacker School!
  It was a very enjoyable and inspiring talk on the whole.
- The plan for today is to actually have the parsed information dumped into
  some persistent format, and modify the inspect code to actually use it.
- I will also be pairing with Kyle for a few hours on working through some of
  [[http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/audio-programming-book]]

I took it easy during the weekend, and went on a nice camp with my a cousin's
family to TobyHanna State Park for a day or so, and spent the remaining (long)
weekend at their place in PA.  It was a pretty nice break!

Yesterday evening, I talked to Madhu about how ugly my code looked while I was
trying to use =libclang=, and he told me that he found a lot of wrapped C++/C
libraries end up being that way, and I also realized that using the Python AST
library seemed much cleaner, because it just contained Python objects, but
representing C/C++ objects in an AST and interacting with them in Python, isn't
that clean.

I cleaned up my code, and removed all the ugly regexes to use libclang to do
the parsing of the libs, and get the source code.  I basically got all the
tests passing, but they were taking an order of magnitude longer to run.  So, I
guess the next step is to cache things somehow.

I also added support for viewing the sources of built-in types.  It was pretty
simple, once I had everything working with libclang.

- I pushed the code onto [[https://github.com/punchagan/cinspect][github]] to let Allison and Tom review it, and Tom was
  quite excited by the idea of having it.
- I added a startup script in IPython, to monkey-patch it to use my code for
  introspection.
- Having never written a C-extension, I read up the Python docs on [[https://docs.python.org/2/extending/extending.html][writing C

  work too well with the Python's sources.

- I got distracted trying to add a hack to Hacker School's [[https://github.com/sursh/blaggregator][blaggregator]], to
  enable posting to different channels on zulip.
- I learnt a few things about Django.  Commented out references to views that
  don't exists breaks templating.  Formsets didn't seem very convenient to use,
  for editing data showing the user only partial forms.
- I played around with Clang for a bit, to try and use libclang to parse the C
  code for inspection, instead of writing one myself.  It sometimes feels like
  an overkill, but it feels like it'll make the whole code more robust.  I'm
  not sure.  I'll need to play around for a bit more to decide.
- I also finally got around to fix the resolution of my tty shells.  I was in a
  bus, and wanted my laptop's battery to last longer, and decided to use a tty
  shell with just emacs running. But, the resolution sucked.  So, I
  fixed. Essentially it involved removing a blacklist file that an old version
  of Nvidia drivers left behind in
  =/usr/share/grub-gfxpayload-lists/blacklist/= and setting
  ~GRUB_GFXMODE=1920x1080~ in =/etc/default/grub=.
- Later in the evening I also bought the domain =octo.cat=, given there were a
  bunch of people buying cat domains, and talking about it on Zulip!

  Tom during the weekend, asking if there was any package that let users
  inspect C sources of builtin modules like ruby's [[https://github.com/pry/pry-doc/][pry-doc]]
- I spent the morning playing around with pry-doc, reading its code, etc.
- The latter part of the day was spent pairing with Tom, and figuring out what
  needs to be done to write a first cut version of something like this.  Ugly
  regexes, FTW! I have something that works for most of the stuff, it seems!
- I also attended an interesting talk about Bit-torrent clients by an alum.

- During the day, I tried to start writing code for different parts of the

  and wrote a little bit of code.
- Later, in the afternoon I paired with some of his iOS code, and helped him

  but ...
- The day ended with a talk by Jesse at EBay, titled [[http://emptysqua.re/blog/write-an-excellent-programming-blog/][Write an Excellent

  announced, and so, most of the content was known, but the Q&A session had
  some interesting suggestions on how to improve your actual writing.

- This Friday we worked on building our own URL shorteners.  It was a fun
  exercise, and I built one that is not persistent, in the two hours.  I worked
  on a not so important problem of having sorted query parameters, instead of
  the more important problem of having a persistent server.  Anyway, I should
  be building something that works, first, before trying to solve the more
  interesting problems.  At least on Fridays.
- I watched this old but interesting talk by Brandon Rhodes, titled [[http://pyvideo.org/video/276/the-mighty-dictionary-55][The Mighty
  Dictionary]], and played around with his [[https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pycon2010-mighty-dictionary/blob/master/figures/_dictinfo.py][_dictinfo]] module after-wards.

  Markov Models. I'm happy to finally understand what these terms mean, after
  seeing them being thrown around for so many years!

- I like how some of the people here are taking check-ins so seriously.  A
  bunch of people posted messages on Zulip, informing that they would not be
  able to make it to check-ins, and seemed quite sorry about it.
- Check-ins are indeed useful.  At the end of every day, I review my work
  wondering what I did, and sometimes end up pushing myself harder, to have
  something reasonable to talk about during the check-ins!
- Yesterday, I read up about FFTs and ended up playing around with =fft= in
  =scipy=, and played around with audacity, etc.  Nothing concrete, really.
- There was a "goals" workshop by Stacey, where she talked about how to get the
  most out of this batch of Hacker School, and then we split into groups of 3,
  and presented our goal-statements to each other, and gave our impressions of
  each others' goals.
- I didn't really have a goal, but the exercise seemed to help, anyway.
- Also, I think it is making me nervous to treat Hacker School as
  super-important.  It is important to make the best use of every hour, every
  minute here, but at the same time, I shouldn't be constantly worrying about
  whether or not, whatever I'm doing is the best use of my time here.
- I think I would like to form some good habits, and make a few good friends,
  more than finish projects and build something uber-cool.  Of course, it would
  be great to build awesome stuff (and may be the only reasonable way to form
  habits, and make friends) but I shouldn't worry too much about time running
  out. Never Graduate!

- I worked for the whole day on implementing [[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0161-119591883944][an algorithm]] to analyze a
  cipher text, and guess the substitution cipher used.  The algorithm
  was pretty straight forward, and I had it "mostly" working, in a
  couple of hours.
- I then began to refactor it, and found that there was what looked
  like a bug, and I "fixed" it mindlessly.  I was essentially trying
  to swap 2 rows, and columns of a pandas data frame.  I had a
  data-frame =D= and its copy =D_=.  I was trying to swap 2 rows and
  columns of =D_=.  I found that the code was initially using the data
  from =D= to do the swap.  To fix it, I checked if tuple unpacking
  did the right thing.  It looked like it did.  So, I used something
  like =_D['a'], D_['b'] = D_['b'], D_['a']=.  Essentially, changed =D=
  on the right hand side to =D_=.  I thought I had tested this on the
  terminal, but after hours of debugging (along with fixing another
  minor issue), I later found out that the tuple unpacking doesn't
  work and the swapped rows and columns actually become equal!  I had
  suspected this initially, and had "tested" this manually, I
  thought.  These are the kinds of things that should have tests for,
  I think.  It wouldn't have taken me too long to write a test, and I
  could have been totally sure that it works!  (I was manually reading
  off values in the array, and probably messed up somewhere)

  FWIW, the code now reads ~_D['a'], D_['b'] = D_['b'].copy(),
  D_['a'].copy()~
- The algo seems to need about 1000 characters to get past the 90%
  accuracy mark.  I could probably tweak it a little to perform
  better, but I'm going to leave it here, for now, and move on to the
  signal processing parts.  I'm not totally sure how the signal
  processing would work, and whether we could actually map back the
  keystrokes to a substitution cipher enciphered text.
- If required, the tweaks could be -
  - Use trigrams instead of bigrams
  - Add a degree of dictionary look-ups: May be something like,
    look-up all the deciphered words, and try not swapping the
    characters that appear in most of the words that are in the
    dictionary.
- This paper is 20 years old, and there would surely be work by others
  building on top of this, or doing it totally differently.

- The Apprenticeship patterns book is very interesting!  I shall
  continue to read it and start create daily/weekly rituals from the
  actions prescribed in the book!
- I was reading [[http://blogs.collab.net/git/protect-git-history#.U6fixh-caV4][this post]] on =git gc=, =reflog=, etc. and wanted to
  see what the default values were for some of the configurable
  variables.  But, the git config command didn't help.  Developer/code
  defaults are also a part of the "config" system, and any tools to
  inspect config variables should display them, if no other values
  have been set explicitly!

- Also, later in the day, Alan gave a presentation mapping the
  internals of git to the commands, trying to give everyone a better
  mental model of Git.
- I spent some time trying to get =jedi= integration for =emacs=. It
  should've worked out of the box, but I'm not sure the ELPA
  repositories have proper dependency/version management.  Seems to be
  the problem, everywhere!  Dependencies of a package get updated, and
  the package starts acting up...
- Chaitu sent me a link about solving mazes using Finite Automata, and
  I spent some time trying to write a simple solver, and compare it
  with Nava's breadth first search.  But, it looks like we broke her
  code during the refactor.  I may get back to this, at some point.
- I also spent a few minutes talking to Kyle, while he was trying to
  implement a simple version of the NTP protocol.  The algorithm it
  turns out, is pretty simple.

- I spent most of Saturday, thinking about what I should be doing for
  the next few weeks, and what I really want to get out of Hacker
  School.
- I had a good discussion with Naren about things that he works on,
  and the kind of things that he sees as hard, what kind of things
  interest me, and what I want to do post Hacker School.  I always
  knew, I didn't really have an area of expertise or an area that I'm
  super interested in, where I want to work.  This discussion only was
  a verbalizing of those thoughts.
- I am not sure, I am very happy with the way I have been learning
  Haskell.  The UPenn course has been reasonably good with the
  exercises provided, and I have been learning through "pseudo"
  projects.  But, I'm wondering if I should pick up a more concrete
  project.
- I played around a little bit with Elm and started something to try
  and write [[https://github.com/huckerdom/layout][Layout]] using Elm.
- I tried cleaning up the phonebook problem from Friday. It works, but
  can definitely be improved with some help from a more experienced
  Haskeller.

- I finished parts of the phonebook task today.  The code looks ugly,
  and very un-haskelly.  I asked for feedback on it, but I guess its
  just too ugly for anyone to take the time out to comment on it, and
  help me improve it.
- I also tried to read up about Monads, and worked through exercises
  from a few different places.  I haven't yet finished the exercises
  in Chapter 12 of the UPenn course.  I just looked at them today, and
  they seem like a complete bouncer at first glance.
- I went on a really long walk with Naren, and food-hopped with him
  while he was telling me stories about the various places he worked
  at and the kinds of things he has been working on, and things he
  liked and disliked about them.  It has been a good weekend to spend
  with Naren!
- Also, the long walk and talking to Chaitu cleared my head a bit, and
  I decided to pause the Haskell tutorials and learning for the next
  couple of weeks.  I don't really have a project that needs me to
  learn Haskell, right now.  I should stick to project and need based
  learning, which I enjoy the most.
- Right now, I feel like working on an key stroke acoustic emanation
  based key-logger.  Just before applying to Hacker School, I came
  across the idea of side-channel attacks, and it sounded pretty
  exciting.  I don't intend to snoop onto anybody, but the project
  seems to be challenging enough, and I will have quite a bit to learn
  about. It will involve signal processing, and learning -- both areas
  that I have seemed interesting to me for long, but I haven't really
  done anything in them.  I plan to work on the idea for a couple of
  weeks, and review my progress and chart my future course. The
  problem appears to have 2 parts to it.
  - Processing audio, and extracting key-strokes from it.
  - Identifying the text, based on a sequence of key-strokes. Though,
    in reality each press of a key may not sound the same, for a start
    assuming we are able to accurately get a sequence of key-strokes,
    the problem would reduce to solving a simple substitution cipher.
    I plan to start with this, tomorrow.
- Also, I plan to hang out a lot more with Hacker Schoolers, and let
  myself be distracted a lot more by random discussions and
  activities, than I have allowed myself to be, in the past few weeks.
  I should be writing as much code as I can, while I'm here.  But, I
  should also be rubbing elbows with the awesome folks, which I will
  only be able to virtually, once I'm out of here.
- Thanks to Amber, I also came across this interesting looking book
  called [[http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813][Apprenticeship patterns]].  I plan to read it over the next
  week or two.
- I haven't been playing almost any Ultimate here. I atleast need to
  work out a conditioning and throwing practice schedule and start
  working on it, early next week.  Tomorrow won't work since it's 5am
  and I'm still awake!
- I also probably need to get enough sleep!
- Looking forward to the next couple of weeks!

- Yesterday was a bit more wandering than usual.  I still have to
  finish (actually, start) the last chapter in the UPenn course
  (Monads).  I hope to finish it during the weekend.

- I started with reading [[http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Typeclassopedia][Typeclassopedia]], in the hope of getting
  comfortable with Functors and Applicatives and to get introduced to
  Monads.  But, I got distracted before I got to the end of the part
  on Functors.

- During the check-ins, Laura and Denise mentioned that they are both
  facing problems with OAuth, and would like to pair on it.  I decided
  to join them, since I've had reasonable luck with OAuth, though I
  knew I didn't understand it very well.  While they were working on
  getting it to work on OSX, I was trying to write a simple Python
  example to do it, and was getting a weird error about the
  =response_type= being not supported.  I was using [[https://github.com/litl/rauth][rauth]] in a way
  very similar to what I had done for [[https://github.com/punchagan/statiki/blob/master/statiki.py#L49][statiki]] but the Hacker School
  API server wasn't letting me through.  I could debug it only a
  little before lunch, and a little bit after lunch.  And realized
  that the =response_type= had to be one of =code= or =token= and not
  =json= or =empty=.  But this is a required parameter, and I expected
  =rauth= to do the right thing!  I got back to it at the end of the
  day, and went through the RFC for OAuth2 and wrote up a simple
  Python script to implement the whole thing, without using any 3rd
  party oauth libraries.  I think I understand the whole thing much
  better now, and will soon write up a blog post on it.

- I spent about an hour or so on reviewing Nava's code (along with
  Tom, Amber and Patricia), that generated and solved mazes. We tried
  to make small incremental changes to her code, and improve it,
  hopefully giving her a sense of how to make the code more
  intentional.

- Thursday evening presentations! People here have been working on
  such cool stuff!  Maze solvers and percolation probability
  calculators, phone gap based mobile applications, a cool Midi based
  music generator, an [[https://github.com/mveytsman/emm-ess-pee][emulator]] for MSP430 in Clojure, an event logger
  in ObjectiveC that can log to a web server and can be used by
  multiple clients to debug communication related issues, a HTTP
  server written from Scratch, a web server in Swift, a pattern
  matching based library in js, a heuristics based puzzle solver, and
  a web editor for jekyll!  Holy cow!  These presentations are
  extremely inspiring and will probably be the thing I look forward to
  the most, for the next 10 weeks.

- I can't believe it's already end of week 2. 10 more to go!

  something new and gain a better understanding of the system I am

- Having something (anything not directly related to the current

  to do me much good. I feel distracted for quite a long period before

- Abstractions and layers were talked about in the second exercise on

  Instapaper works, but doesn't work as well as I would like it to.  I
  just want a simple script that takes a list of urls and does the

  even better someone already has.
- I worked through exercises 08 and 10 of the haskell course,
  yesterday.
- Chapter 8 was about how IO works in haskell.  The exercise didn't
  involve too much, except I wasted a lot of time on tracking a
  stupidity of mine.
- The next part of the course was an introduction to Functors,
  Applicative and Alternative.  I'm not sure I totally understand and
  am comfortable with them, but I have been able to get through the
  exercises.
- I think it's time for me to start working on some Elm tutorials,
  along with the Haskell exercises.
- Also, I had questions about when to use =type=, =newtype= and =data=
  and incidentally found [[http://learnyouahaskell.com/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids#the-newtype-keyword][this section]] that ended with the following
  summary: "If you just want your type signatures to look cleaner and
  be more descriptive, you probably want =type= synonyms. If you want
  to take an existing type and wrap it in a new type in order to make
  it an instance of a type class, chances are you're looking for a
  =newtype=.  And if you want to make something completely new, odds
  are good that you're looking for the =data= keyword."

- Didn't do anything during the weekend.  Hopefully, this won't be the
  case all of the weekends.  I had fun with my cousins, though.
- Denise is already working on a twitter app that sounds similar to
  the idea I had.
- I accidentally discovered that evince supports vim-like keybindings,
  which is cool.
- When writing patterns for a function it helps to write the most
  general case first, and then write the edge cases.
- I was feeling a little unproductive in the afternoon and I ended up
  attending Zach's talk on [[https://github.com/hackerschool/community][Community]].  I got a brief overview of the
  whole architecture, and got to know a little bit about reactjs and
  om. I don't think I'll get around to contributing to the project,
  since most of the stack is totally new to me, and I'm not
  particularly inclined to learn those things now.
- I was working on Monoids for most part of the day and got through
  exercise 7.  I started doing the I/O exercise around the end of the
  day.
- The day ended with a talk on jobs related stuff by Nick and Sonali.
  It seems super unlikely for me to get a job (in the US), from what I
  understood from them.  So, I needn't worry too much about that and
  focus on getting better at Haskel and as a programmer in general.

- Came to know about the project that Tom is working on for being able
  to auth integration of GitHub and Hacker School.  This will be useful
  for me, when I get to working on the GitHub dashboard.
- I spent an hour or so to clean up by blog workflow and help scripts
  to insert tags in Nikola posts, etc.  I also have a [[https://github.com/punchagan/home-bin/blob/master/hs-post][script]] to make a
  post for each day, automatically.
- lolcommit is an interesting project, and Max is using it for logging
  his work at Hacker School.
- Learned about laziness and the consequences of it. You cannot have
  side-effects, in a lazy language, if you want to keep the sanity of
  the developers using your language.
- Pattern matching forces evaluation.
- Also, briefly read about =seq=, halting problem and =bottom= from
  the Haskell wiki.
- The week ended with presentations by Hacker Schoolers from this
  batch.  It was also Alum day, so we had some Alumni visiting.  I
  missed half of the presentations because I had to leave early for
  Suguna's graduation.

I hope to continue to do some work on the tutorials during the
weekend, and get back to it and finish them next week.

*** Plan
  Continue with the Haskell tutorials, with additional reading from
  Real World Haskell.

*** Actual
  - Finished exercises 4 and 5.
    - Learnt about Type classes in Haskell and how to create them and
      make data types instances of them.
    - Also came across a new algorithm of sieving called the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Sundaram][Sieve of
      Sundaram]], which was discovered by a student.  Surprisingly, I
      never heard of it before!

*** Miscellaneous
  - A few of us had an interesting discussion about various places
    people grew up in and visited, and the cultures, etc.
  - Idea: implement a GitHub dashboard for organizations (say, HS
    batches) that give you different statistics, and interesting
    graphs. (Use elm?) [Update: Tom is working on HS and GitHub
    integration. So, that's perfect!]

I came super early to try and get some work done in the quiet before
the daily checkins time.  Continued with the Haskell tutorial and
reading the Real World Haskell.

Finished a couple of exercises from the UPenn course, that were pretty
straight forward.

Also, finished a few exercises from chapter 3 of real world haskell,
and partially finished implementing Graham scan for generating a
convex hull for a set of points.

The exercises from both the places involved mainly learning about
Algebraic Data Types.

Mary pinged me to ask how the first couple of days were, and it was
good to talk to get a ping from her though I never talked to her.

I'm going to continue working on the Haskell exercises today.

I also got a couple of ideas for small projects:

- Since, yelp is blocked from here, nobody can use yelp's API and work
  on any projects.  It may be helpful to have an API proxy server that
  runs on a different server and forwards any requests coming to it.
- A simple script to create a twitter list for each batch of
  Hacker School.

Doing them in Python would be pretty straight forward. I will try to
work on these things in Haskell, once I'm reasonably comfortable with
Haskell.

Finally, I'm at Hacker School.  The day began with introductions,
breakfast and welcomes to HackerSchool.

The four rules of Hacker School were reiterated to all of us:

- No (Feigning) surprise
- No Well-actuallys
- No Backseat driving
- No Subtle-isms

It was made clear that each of us should watch ourselves not to break
these rules, and being called on breaking these rules is totally cool,
and we should stop about it and think for a moment and move-on.
Breaking the rules doesn't make us bad hacker schoolers.  We are all
here to learn!

I liked the idea of all of us being asked to list out the things that
we are nervous about, and excited about.  I was happy to find that a
lot of the people were nervous about the similar kinds of things I was
nervous about.  I'm not alone!

After the check-ins, I started off with the Introduction to [[http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/][Haskell course]] by
[[http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/][Brent Yorgey]].  What I did was mostly a recap of what I learned from the first
few chapters of [[http://learnyouahaskell.com][Learn you a Haskell]].  I learnt about how credit card numbers
are validated, apart from learning a little bit about lazy evaluation and
thunks.

The day ended with burritos and game night Mafia!

I first heard of this book in a discussion on relationships amongst friends
from RC.  The discussion was quite interesting and the book received more than
a couple of strong recommendations. So, I decided to pick it up.

Very simply, the book is codified common sense explaining what Love is. Gary
Chapman, the author, started with the question "What makes you feel loved" and
found that the answers could be grouped into the following 5 categories:

1. Words of affirmation
2. Quality time
3. Receiving gifts
4. Acts of service
5. Physical touch,

which he calls the languages of love.  He also proposes that people have a
*primary* language of love, and a failure to speak to a person in their primary
language would make them feel unloved.

The book is filled with anecdotes to explain what each of these languages means
and how to speak them, along with practical advice and exercises to learn to
speak each of these languages.  Though the book has been written with couples
in mind, the fundamental ideas in this book can be applied to any
relationships. I feel like it has been helping me connect a few dots, ever
since I've started reading it.

It has been totally worth my time to read this book. A highly recommended read!

Below are some of my notes. Feel free to suggest improvements (for readability
and otherwise) on the notes.

A collection of quotes. I keep coming back to them for inspiration. Or for
brighter perspectives on life.

- Furious activity is no substitute for understanding. --
  /H.H. Williams -- Activity/

- A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,
  butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet,
  balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take
  orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze
  a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal,
  fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.  --
  /Robert A. Heinlein -- Human Beings/

- Nothing ever becomes real till it is experienced -- even a proverb is
  no proverb to you till your life has illustrated it. -- /John Keats/

- We lie loudest when we lie to ourselves. -- /Eric Hoffer/

- The first hour of the morning is the rudder of the day. -- /Henry
  Ward Beecher/

- Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally
  for machines to execute. -- /Abelson & Sussman -- SICP, preface to
  the first edition/

- In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst
  into flame by an encounter with another human being. We should all be
  thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit.  -- /Albert
  Schweitzer, 1875 - 1965/

- Anyone who cannot cope with mathematics is not fully human.  At best he is a
  tolerable subhuman who has learned to wear shoes, bathe and not make messes
  in the house.  -- /Lazarus Long, Time Enough for Love/

- You probably wouldn't worry about what people think of you if you could know
  how seldom they do. -- /Olin Miller/

- If you judge people, you have no time to love them. -- /Mother Teresa/

- Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not
  giving it. -- /William Arthur Ward/

-
   #+begin_verse
     Where the mind is without fear and the head held high;
     Where knowledge is free;
     Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
     Where words come out from the depth of truth;
     Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection;
     Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
     Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening thought and action;
     Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.
   #+end_verse
   /Rabindranath Tagore -- Let My Country Awake/

- The true Enlightenment thinker, the true rationalist, never wants to talk
  anyone into anything. No, he does not even want to convince; all the time he
  is aware that he may be wrong. Above all, he values the intellectual
  independence of others too highly to want to convince them in important
  matters. He would much rather invite contradiction, preferably in the form of
  rational and disciplined criticism. He seeks not to convince but to arouse --
  to challenge others to form free opinions. -- /Karl Popper -- On Freedom/

- Don't ask yourself what the world needs; ask yourself what makes you come
  alive. And then go and do that. Because what the world needs is people who
  have come alive. -- /Howard Thurman/

- All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn't hurt. --
  /Charles M Schultz/

- Somewhere in the world someone is training when you are not. When you race
  him, he will win. -- /Tom Fleming/

- Because when something happens, she's the person I want to tell. The
  most basic indicator of love. -- /David Levithan/

- If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product,
  you've launched too late. -- /Reid Hoffman/

- Nothing of me is original. I am the combined effort of everyone I've ever
  known. -- /Chuck Palahniuk/

- I fell in love with the way you sleep; slowly then all at once -- /John
  Green/

- The enjoyment of one's tools is an essential ingredient of successful
  work. -- /Donald E. Knuth/

- Respect yourself enough to walk away from anything that no longer serves you,
  grows you, or makes you happy. -- /Robert Tew/

- It is not in the stars to hold our destiny but in ourselves. -- /William
  Shakespeare/

- I saw that my life was a vast glowing empty page and I could do anything I
  wanted. -- /Jack Kerouac/

- The truth is, everyone is going to hurt you. You just got to find the ones
  worth suffering for. -- /Bob Marley/

- Scientists study the world as it is; engineers create the world that has
  never been. -- /Theodore von Karman/

- If you can love someone with your whole heart, even one person, then there's
  salvation in life. Even if you can’t get together with that person. --
  /Haruki Murakami/

- The truth is rarely pure and never simple -- /Oscar Wilde/

- Memories warm you up from the inside. But they also tear you apart. --
  /Haruki Murakami/

- We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a
  habit. -- /Aristotle/

- Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in a long-shot. --
  /Charlie Chaplin/

- Another flaw in the human character is that everyone wants to build and
  nobody wants to do maintenance. -- /Kurt Vonnegut/

- In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes
  on. -- /Robert Frost/

- Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore,
  if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not
  smart enough to debug it. -- /Brian Kernighan/

- Lighthouses don’t go running all over an island looking for boats to save;
  they just stand there shining. -- /Anne Lamott/

- Life is an awful, ugly place to not have a best friend. -- /Sarah Dessen/

- Warning: everything saved will be lost. -- /Wii notification/

- Happiness is nothing more than good health and a bad memory.  -- /Albert
  Schweitzer/

- Silence is the language of god. All else is poor translation. -- /Rumi/

- To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will
  certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make sure of
  keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an
  animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all
  entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your
  selfishness. But in that casket -- safe, dark, motionless, airless -- it will
  change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable,
  irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, or at least to the risk of tragedy,
  is damnation. The only place outside of Heaven where you can be perfectly
  safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell. -- /C. S. Lewis/

- Quality is the result of a million selfless acts of care -- not just of any
  great method that descends from the heavens. That these acts are simple
  doesn't mean that they are simplistic; and it hardly means that they are
  easy. They are nonetheless the fabric of greatness and, more so, of beauty in
  any human endeavor. To ignore them is not yet to be fully human.  -- /James
  O. Coplien, Foreword to Clean Code/

- We are all in the same boat, in a stormy sea, and we owe each other a
  terrible loyalty. -- /G.K. Chesterton/

- The road to wisdom? -- Well, it's plain and simple to express:

  #+BEGIN_VERSE
  Err
  and err
  and err again
  but less
  and less
  and less.
  #+END_VERSE

  -- /Piet Hein (Grooks)/

- My idea of dominating is that I get all of the players on my team to play
  better than if I wasn't there. -- /Ben Wiggins/

- It is a risk to love. What if it doesn't work out? Ah, but what if it does.
  -- /Peter McWilliams/

- Wherever you go, go with all your heart -- /Confucius/

- Satisfaction of one's curiosity is one of the greatest sources of happiness
  in life. -- /Linus Pauling/

- I wanted to change the world. But I have found that the only thing one can be
  sure of changing is oneself. -- /Aldous Huxley/

- The true voyage of discovery consists not of going to new places, but of
  having a new pair of eyes. -- /Marcel Proust (1871–1922)/

- All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. --
  /Edmund Burke/

- I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep
  fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course,
  the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we
  began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really
  were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these
  machines. I don't think we are. I think we're responsible for stretching
  them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I
  hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I
  hope we don't become missionaries. Don't feel as if you're Bible
  salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What you know about
  computing other people will learn. Don't feel as if the key to successful
  computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think and hope, is
  intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first
  led up to it, that you can make it more. -- /Alan J. Perlis (April 1,
  1922-February 7, 1990)/

- Forgetting is like radiation: you cannot smell it, you cannot taste it, and
  when you finally notice the damage, it is already irreversible -- /Piotr
  Wozniack/

- Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about
  telescopes -- /Edsger Dijkstra/

- Do anything, but let it produce joy. -- /Walt Whitman/

- Learn to value yourself, which means: fight for your happiness -- /Ayn Rand/

- If you don't stand for something you will fall for anything -- /Malcolm X/

- Do you want to know who you are? Don't ask. Act! Action will delineate and
  define you -- /Thomas Jefferson/

- We will be held accountable for all the permitted pleasures we failed to
  enjoy. -- /Talmud Yerwshalmi/

- It's so easy to hate. It takes strength to be gentle and kind. -- /The
  Smiths/

- To be trusted is a greater compliment than being loved -- /George MacDonald/

- I am more convinced than ever. Conceptual integrity is central to product
  quality. -- /Fred Brooks/

- If the software doesn't have to work, you can always meet any other
  requirement. -- /Gerald Weinberg/

- Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you
  didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from
  the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your
  sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. -- /Mark Twain/

- Be careful when you fight the monsters, lest you become one. -- /Friedrich
  Nietzsche/

- Assume nobody else has any idea what they're doing either. A lot of people
  refuse to try something because they feel they don't know enough about it or
  they assume other people must have already tried everything they could have
  thought of. Well, few people really have any idea how to do things right and
  even fewer are to try new things, so usually if you give your best shot at
  something you'll do pretty well. -- /Aaron Swartz/

- What makes this advice especially hollow and pious is that I am not dead
  yet. If it were any good, I could easily take it myself.  -- /Kurt Vonnegut,
  in a letter to his daughter Nanny/

- Go out and walk. That is the glory of life. -- /Artist Maira Kalman/

- I think it's pretty cool that there are tutorials to do things that are
  pretty near the state of the art. -- /Dan L. on tutorials in Theano for doing
  Deep Learning stuff/

- All things worth doing are frustrating. How much satisfaction do you get from
  doing something easy? -- /Joe Armstrong/ on [[https://twitter.com/joeerl/status/673428125737459712][Twitter]]

- Be happy with what you have. Be excited about what you want. -- /Alan Cohen/

- If you love something, be prepared to lose it. -- /Haruki Murakami/ in a [[https://twitter.com/_harukimurakami/status/676021631660130304][Tweet]]

- Let death be what takes us, not lack of imagination -- /BJ Miller/ in a [[https://www.ted.com/talks/bj_miller_what_really_matters_at_the_end_of_life/][TED talk]]

- One doesn't discover new lands without consenting to lose sight, for a very
  long time, of the shore. -- /André Gide/ in Les faux-monnayeurs [The
  Counterfeiters]

- A good life is not a life without problems. A good life is a life with good
  problems. -- /Mark Manson/ in a [[http://markmanson.net/be-patient][blog post]]

-  HEY, FRIENDS. PLEASE BOTHER ME. -- /Kara M/ on Zulip on "What really
  matters".

- Joy is the best makeup -- /Anne Lamott/

- I am rarely happier than when spending an entire day programming my computer
  to perform automatically a task that would otherwise take me a good ten
  seconds to do by hand -- /Douglas Adams/ in [[http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/587524-i-have-a-well-deserved-reputation-for-being-something-of-a][Last Chance to See]].

- Don't wait for a light to appear at the end of the tunnel, stride down there
  and light the bloody thing yourself. -- /Sara Henderson/ in [[https://www.goodreads.com/quotes_of_the_day/1746][From Strength to
  Strength]]

- It doesn't matter where you are, you are nowhere compared to where you can
  go. -- /Bob Proctor/

- Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of high intention,
  sincere effort, intelligent direction and skillful execution; it represents
  the wise choice of many alternatives. -- /William A. Foster/

- How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives -- /Annie Dillard/

- The truth is, most of us discover where we are headed when we arrive. --
  /Bill Watterson/

- The people you love aren't interruptions, they’re the reason you work at
  all. Give 'em a hug. -- /Jason Zimdars/ in this [[https://m.signalvnoise.com/why-i-work-remotely-hint-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-productivity-34ace30f74fc#.jliostsa5][post]]

- Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity. -- /Simone Weil/

- Ten years from now, make sure you can say that you chose your life, you
  didn’t settle for it. -- Mandy Hale, The Single Woman
