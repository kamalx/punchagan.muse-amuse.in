** Build

Use =hugo.sh= in local dev workflow:

#+begin_src sh
$ ./hugo.sh serve
#+end_src

The script is a way to lock Hugo version and prevent things from breaking with updates to Hugo.

** Deploy

Use =deploy.sh= to deploy the website! It asks for a confirmation with the
diff. Useful in cases where the theme was changed or Hugo was updated, etc.
